./scripts/typecheck-file.sh apps/prairielearn/src/pages/instructorQuestionCreate/components/CreateQuestionForm.tsx fails, but the build succeeds. there is a bug in the typechecking script

---

can you explain this fix more?

Full build (include: ["**/*"]) includes test files that import 'jsdom'. which files are this?

---

thats crazy! can you explain how the test code would get pulled in to a build when i compile that file?

---

seems like an underlying issue in my tsconfig, right? or no. this seems unintended

---

yes, look into it

---

so the src/tsconfig.json right now is intended to prevent DOM at runtime, but because of this include setup, it actually allows it?

Can you give me an expected snipped that would fail

---

Can you capture this in an issue? draft it first. explain the original issue, and show the minimal repro of the bug, and suggest a fix.

---

nope, make the issue
