/**
 * Sentry v8 switched from simple, manual instrumentation to "automatic"

 * specifically the Sentry DSN. Sentry's automatic request isolation and
 * request data extraction requires that `Sentry.init` be called before
 * any other code is loaded, but our application startup structure is such
 * that we import most of our own code before we can load the Sentry DSN.
 *
 * Rather than jumping through hoops to restructure our application to
 * support this, this small function can be added as Express middleware to
 * isolate requests and set request data for Sentry.
