# `@prairielearn/named-locks`

Uses Postgres row-level locks to grant exclusive access to resources.

## Usage

You must first call `init` with Postgres connection details and an idle error handler:

```ts
import { init } from '@prairielearn/named-locks';

await init(
  {
    user: 'postgres',
    // ... other Postgres config
  },
  (err) => {
    throw err;
  }
);
```

You can then obtain a lock and do work while it is held. The lock will be automatically released once the provided function either resolves or rejects.

```ts
import { doWithLock } from '@prairielearn/named-locks';

await doWithLock('name', {}, async () => {
  console.log('Doing some work');
});
```

Optionally, you may configure the lock to automatically "renew" itself by periodically making no-op queries in the background. This is useful for operations that may take longer than the configured Postgres idle session timeout.

```ts
import { doWithLock } from '@prairielearn/named-locks';

await doWithLock(
  'name',
  {
    autoRenew: true,
  },
  async () => {
    console.log('Doing some work');
  }
);
```

### Advanced usage

Normally, it's preferable to use `doWithLock`, as it will automatically release the lock in case of failure. However, for advanced usage, you can manually acquire and release a lock.

```ts
import { waitLockAsync, releaseLockAsync } from '@prairielearn/named-locks';

const lock = await waitLockAsync('name', {});
try {
  console.log('Doing some work');
} finally {
  await releaseLockAsync(lock);
}
```

If you only want to acquire a lock if it's immediately available, you can use `tryLockAsync` instead:

```ts
import { tryLockAsync, releaseLockAsync } from '@prairielearn/named-locks';

const lock = await waitLockAsync('name', {});
if (lock) {
  try {
    console.log('Doing some work');
  } finally {
    await releaseLockAsync(lock);
  }
} else {
  console.log('Lock not acquired');
}
```
