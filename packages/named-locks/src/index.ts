/*
 * The functions here all identify locks by "name", which is a plain
 * string. The locks use the named_locks DB table. Each lock name
 * corresponds to a unique table row. To take a lock, we:
 *     1. make sure a row exists for the lock name
 *     2. start a transaction
 *     3. acquire a "FOR UPDATE" row lock on the DB row for the named
 *        lock (this blocks all other locks on the same row). See
 *        https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/explicit-locking.html#LOCKING-ROWS
 *     4. return to the caller with the transaction held open
 *
 * The caller then does some work and finally calls releaseLock(),
 * which ends the transaction, thereby releasing the row lock.
 *
 * The flow above will wait indefinitely for the lock to become
 * available. To implement optional timeouts, we set the DB variable
 * `lock_timeout`:
 * https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-client.html#GUC-LOCK-TIMEOUT
 * If we timeout then we will return an error to the caller.
 *
 * To implement a no-waiting tryLock() we use the PostgreSQL "SKIP
 * LOCKED" feature:
 * https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-select.html#SQL-FOR-UPDATE-SHARE
 * If we fail to acquire the lock then we immediately release the
 * transaction and return to the caller with `lock = null`. In this
 * case the caller should not call releaseLock().
 *
 * The lock object returned by functions in this module are of the
 * form `{client, done}`, where `client` and `done` are sqldb
 * transaction objects. These are simply the objects we need to end
 * the transaction, which will release the lock.
 *
 * Importantly, we use a separate pool of database connections for acquiring
 * and holding locks. This ensures that we don't end up with a deadlock.
 * For instance, if we have a pool of 10 clients and there are 10 locks held at
 * once, if any code inside of a lock tries to acquire another database client,
 * we'd deadlock if we weren't separating the two pools of connections.
 *
 * You should NEVER try to acquire a lock in code that is executing with another
 * lock already held. Since there are a finite pool of locks available, this
 * can lead to deadlocks.
