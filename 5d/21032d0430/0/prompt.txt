The changes introduce two functional regressions: client-side validation can be bypassed due to async submit handling, and clearing all tags persists an empty tag value. Both issues
  affect correctness of saved question settings.

  Full review comments:

  - [P1] Prevent default before awaiting async form validation — /Users/peter/work/PrairieLearn/apps/prairielearn/src/pages/instructorQuestionSettings/components/
    QuestionSettingsForm.tsx:227-231
    The submit handler calls await trigger() and only then e.preventDefault(), but form submission is not paused while async work runs, so invalid forms can still submit before
    preventDefault executes. This bypasses the new client-side checks (e.g., duplicate QID or malformed JSON fields) and can send bad payloads to the server, where JSON.parse(...) paths
    can throw and return an error page instead of inline validation feedback.
  - [P1] Omit empty hidden tag value when no tags are selected — /Users/peter/work/PrairieLearn/packages/ui/src/components/ComboBox.tsx:243-248
    When no tags are selected, this renders a hidden tags input with value="", so the backend receives tags: '' instead of an omitted field. With ArrayFromStringOrArraySchema, that
    becomes [''], and saving writes an empty-string tag into info.json rather than clearing tags. This creates invalid tag data whenever a user clears all tags and saves.
