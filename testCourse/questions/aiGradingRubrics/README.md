Add the following rubric items:

- Identified that the bounds of the loop are incorrect.
  - grader note: The upper bound specified in `range` should be 6 to ensure that 5 is included.
  - points: 2
- Identified that the coefficient of 3 is incorrect.
  - grader note: The coefficient of `i` should be 2.
  - points: 2

Here's a response that should receive full points:

> The upper bound is wrong (the argument to `range` should be 6) and the coefficient of 3 should be 2.

Here's a response that should receive partial points:

> The upper bound is wrong (the argument to `range` should be 6).

Here's a response that should receive no points:

> There are missing parentheses around the number 2.
