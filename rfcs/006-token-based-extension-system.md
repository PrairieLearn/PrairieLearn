# Token-based Extension System for Assessments

## Introduction

The purpose of this RFC is to propose a token-based extension system for assessments in order to provide students with a flexible mechanism for requesting deadline extensions. This system will allow students to utilize tokens they receive at the beginning of the semester to apply for extensions on their assessments. Instructors will have control over the allocation and usage of tokens within defined assessment sets, allowing them to manage and customize extension policies according to their course requirements.

## Token Allocation

2.1 Initial Allocation: At the start of the semester, all students will receive a fixed number of tokens. The exact number of tokens per student should be determined based on factors such as the course workload and assessment distribution.

2.2 Additional Tokens: Instructors will have the discretion to assign additional tokens to individual students on a case-by-case basis if deemed necessary. This flexibility allows instructors to accommodate special circumstances or provide extra support to specific students.

## Token Usage

3.1 Extension Types: Each token will represent a specific type of extension, and the following options are proposed as initial suggestions:
a) One token = one day extension
b) One token = one week extension
c) One token = student selects the new due date

3.2 Token Constraints: Instructors will define the assessment sets where tokens can be utilized at the course instance level. Assessment sets can include various types of assessments such as homework, quizzes, exams, machine problems, etc. By specifying token constraints, instructors can control which assessments are eligible for extension requests using tokens. This provides instructors with the flexibility to tailor the extension policy to suit the nature and requirements of each assessment.

## Requesting Extensions

4.1 Student Request: When a student requires an extension on a specific assessment within an eligible assessment set, they can submit a request indicating the desired length of the extension.

4.2 Token Consumption: Upon approval of the extension request, the system will deduct the appropriate number of tokens from the student's token balance based on the chosen extension type.

4.3 Token Validation: The system will verify if the student has a sufficient number of tokens to cover the requested extension. If the student lacks the necessary tokens, the request will be automatically rejected.

## Considerations and Future Enhancements

5.1 Token Exhaustion: In the event that a student runs out of tokens but still requires an extension, alternative procedures or policies should be established. For instance, instructors can choose to allow additional extension requests without tokens or require alternative forms of justification.

5.2 Token Transfer: It may be worth considering the ability for students to transfer tokens between themselves, subject to appropriate constraints and regulations defined by the instructor. This feature could enhance collaboration and enable students to support each other in managing their deadlines effectively.

5.3 Token Expiration: Tokens could be set to expire at a specific point in the semester to encourage students to utilize them within a reasonable timeframe and discourage hoarding.

5.4 Reporting and Analytics: Building reporting capabilities and analytics around token usage can provide valuable insights to instructors, helping them understand patterns, identify potential issues, and make informed decisions regarding extensions and workload management.

## Conclusion

The proposed token-based extension system for assessments aims to provide students with a flexible mechanism for requesting extensions while giving instructors control over token allocation and usage within defined assessment sets. By implementing this system, we can improve the overall management of deadlines and enhance the learning experience for students.
