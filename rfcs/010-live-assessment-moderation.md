# Summary

Establish a dashboard by which instructors can view students' progress on assessments in real-time.

# Motivation and background

During timed assessments such as exams, instructors currently have to refresh the page every time they want to see the latest statistics for students taking said assessment, and potentially also click into individual instances. This RFC proposes a real-time dashboard for assessments allowing instructors to see students' progress as submissions come in. This will provide a singular, live point of access which eliminates the need to reload everything on the page.
