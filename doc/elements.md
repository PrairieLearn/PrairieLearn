# PrairieLearn Elements for use in `question.html`

When writing questions, there exists a core pool of elements that provides 
common structures associated with assessment items. These elements can be
split into three distinct groups: **submission**, **decorative**, and 
**conditional**. Within this document, all of PrairieLearn's elements are
displayed alongside links to sample elements within the example course. To
build your own PrairieLearn element, please see [Question Element Writing](devElements.md)
documentation.

**Submission** elements act as a way to receive a response or input from the
student. These elements are traditionally referred to as form input fields. 
PrairieLearn presently provides the following templated **input field** elements:

- [`pl-multiple-choice`](#pl-multiple-choice-element): Selecting only 
  **one option** from a list.
- [`pl-checkbox`](#pl-checkbox-element): Selecting **multiple options** from a
  list.
- [`pl-number-input`](#pl-number-input-element): Fill in a **numerical** value 
  within a specific tolerance level such as 3.14, -1.921, and so on.
- [`pl-integer-input`](#pl-integer-input-element): Fill in an **integer** value 
  such as -71, 0, 5, 21, and so on.
- [`pl-symbolic-input`](#pl-symbolic-input-element): Fill in a **symbolic** value
  such as `x^2`, `sin(z)`, `mc^2`, and so on.
- [`pl-string-input`](#pl-string-input-element): Fill in a **string** value
  such as "Illinois", "GATTACA", "computer", and so on.
- [`pl-matrix-component-input`](#pl-matrix-component-input-element): Fill in
  a **matrix** using grid that has an input area for each element.
- [`pl-matrix-input`](#pl-matrix-input-element): Supply a matrix in a supported
  programming language format.
- [`pl-file-editor`](#pl-file-editor-element): Provide an in-browser code editor
  for writing and submitting code.
- [`pl-file-upload`](#pl-file-upload-element): Provide a submission area
  to obtain a file with a specific naming scheme.
- [`pl-threejs`](#pl-threejs-element): Enables 3D scene display and problem
  submission.

**Decorative** elements are meant to improve how the question is displayed to
students. Elements under this category include ways to specify question markup,
images, files, and code display. The following **decorative** elements are available:

- [`pl-code`](#pl-code-element): Displays code rendered with the appropriate
  syntax highlighting. 
- [`pl-figure`](#pl-figure-element): Embed an image file in the question.
- [`pl-file-download`](#pl-file-download-element): Enable file downloads for
  data-centric questions.
- [`pl-variable-output`](#pl-variable-output-element): Displays matrices in 
  code form for supported programming languages.
- [`pl-matrix-latex`](#pl-matrix-latex-element): Displays matrices using 
  appropriate LaTeX commands for use in a mathematical expression.
- [`pl-prairiedraw-figure`](#pl-prairiedraw-figure-element): Show a PrairieDraw
  figure.
- [`pl-graphviz-render`](#pl-graphviz-render-element): Show a Graphviz DOT 
  figure.
  
**Conditional** elements are meant to improve the feedback and question structure.
These elements conditionally render their content depending on the question state.
The following **Conditional** elements are available:

- [`pl-question-panel`](#pl-question-panel-element): Displays the text of a
  question.
- [`pl-submission-panel`](#pl-submission-panel-element): Displays the answer 
  given by the student.
- [`pl-answer-panel`](#pl-answer-panel-element): Displays the correct
  answer to a given question.
- [`pl-hide-in-panel`](#pl-hide-in-panel-element): Hides content in one or more display panels.
- [`pl-external-grader-results`](#pl-external-grader-results-element):
  Displays results from questions that are externally graded.

Note: PrairieLearn Elements listed next have been **deprecated**. These elements
will be removed at a future date.

- [`pl-variable-score`](#pl-variable-score-element): Displays a partial score
  for a submitted element.
    - **Deprecated** as submission elements in `v3` all have score display options.

## Submission Elements

--- | --- | --- | ---
`correct` | boolean | false | Is this a correct answer to the question?

#### Details

Two grading methods are available when using `partial-credit="true"`:

* `'EDC'` (Every Decision Counts): in this method, the checkbox answers are considered as a list of true/false answers.  If `n` is the total number of answers, each answer is assigned `1/n` points. The total score is the summation of the points for every correct answer selected and every incorrect answer left unselected.

* `'PC'` (Percent Correct): in this method, 1 point is added for each correct answer that is marked as correct and 1 point is subtracted for each incorrect answer that is marked as correct. The final score is the resulting summation of points divided by the total number of correct answers. The minimum final score is set to zero.

#### Details

Correct answers are best created as `sympy` expressions and converted to json using:

```python
import prairielearn as pl
import sympy

def generate(data):
    sympy.var('x y')
    data['correct_answer']['ans'] = pl.to_json(x + y + 1)
```

It is also possible to specify the correct answer simply as a string, e.g., `x + y + 1`.

Do not include `i` or `j` in the list of `variables` if `allow-complex="true"`. Do not include any other reserved name in your list of `variables` (`e`, `pi`, `cos`, `sin`, etc.) The element code will check for (and disallow) conflicts between your list of `variables` and reserved names.

`atol` | number | 1e-8 | Absolute tolerance for `comparison="relabs"`.
`digits` | integer | 2 | number of digits that must be correct for `comparison="sigfig"` or `comparison="decdig"`.
`allow-complex` | boolean | false | Whether or not to allow complex numbers as answers. If the correct answer `ans` is a complex object, you should use `import prairielearn as pl` and `data['correct_answer'][answers-name] = pl.to_json(ans)`.

#### Details

Here is an example of valid MATLAB format:
```
[1.23; 4.56]
```

Here is an example of valid Python format:
```
[[1.23], [4.56]]
```

A scalar will be accepted either as a matrix of size $1\times 1$ (e.g., `[1.23]` or `[[1.23]]`) or just as a single number (e.g., `1.23`).

In the answer panel, a `pl-matrix-input` element displays the correct answer, allowing the user to switch between matlab and python format.

In the submission panel, a `pl-matrix-input` element displays either the submitted answer (in the same format that it was submitted, either MATLAB or Python), or a note that the submitted answer was invalid (with an explanation of why).

#### Example implementations

- [`multiplyTwoComplexMatrices`: Example entry of a matrix that uses complex numbers.](https://github.com/PrairieLearn/PrairieLearn/tree/master/exampleCourse/questions/multiplyTwoComplexMatrices)

## `pl-threejs` element


This element displays a 3D scene with objects that the student can (optionally) translate and/or rotate. It can be used only for output (e.g., as part of a question that asks for something else to be submitted). Or, it can be used for input (e.g., comparing a submitted pose of the body-fixed objects to a correct orientation). Information about the current pose can be hidden from the student and, if visible, can be displayed in a variety of formats, so the element can be used for many different types of questions.

#### Sample Element

![](elements/pl-threejs.png)

```html
<pl-threejs answer-name="a">
    <pl-threejs-stl file-name="MAKE_Robot_V6.stl" frame="body" scale="0.1"></pl-threejs-stl>
    <pl-threejs-stl file-name="MAKE_Robot_V6.stl" frame="body" scale="0.025" position="[-1,1,2]" orientation="[0,0,30]"></pl-threejs-stl>

## `pl-figure` element

Display a statically or dynamically generated image.

#### Sample Element

![](elements/pl-figure.png)

```html
<!-- show a figure from an existing file -->
<pl-figure file-name="figure.png" directory="clientFilesCourse"></pl-figure>

<!-- show a figure from a file that is generated by code -->
<pl-figure file-name="figure.png" type="dynamic"></pl-figure>
```

#### Customizations

Attribute | Type | Default | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
`file-name` | string | — | Name of image file.

`width` | number | `None` | Width of image (e.g., '250px').

#### Details

If `type="dynamic"`, then the contents of the image file must be returned by a function `file()` that is located either in element code or in `server.py`. The contents must be a string (with utf-8 encoding), a bytes-like object, or a file-like object. The filename will be available to this function as `data['filename']`. For example, this code might appear in `server.py` to generate a file called `figure.png`:

```python
def file(data):
    if data['filename']=='figure.png':
        plt.plot([1,2,3],[3,4,-2])
        buf = io.BytesIO()
        plt.savefig(buf,format='png')

The contents must be a string (with utf-8 encoding), a bytes-like object, or a file-like object. The filename will be available to this function as `data['filename']`. For example, this code might appear in `server.py` to generate a file called `data.txt`:

```python
def file(data):
    if data['filename']=='data.txt':
        return 'This data is generated by code.'
```

If `file()` does not return anything, it will be treated as if `file()` returned the empty string.

#### Details

This element displays a list of variables inside `<pre>` tags that are formatted for import into either MATLAB, Mathematica, or Python (the user can switch between them). Each variable must be either a scalar or a 2D numpy array (expressed as a list). Each variable will be prefixed by the text that appears between the `<variable>` and `</variable>` tags, followed by ` = `.

Here is an example of MATLAB format:

```
A = [1.23; 4.56]; % matrix
```

Here is an example of the Mathematica format:

```
A = [1.23; 4.56]; (* matrix *)
```

Here is an example of Python format:

```
import numpy as np

A = np.array([[1.23], [4.56]]) # matrix
```

If a variable `v` is a complex object, you should use `import prairielearn as pl` and `data['params'][params-name] = pl.to_json(v)`.

## `pl-matrix-latex` element

Displays a matrix written in latex using mathjax.

#### Customizations

![](elements/pl-matrix-latex.png)

```html
<pl-matrix-latex params-name="A"></pl-matrix-latex>
```

Attribute | Type | Default | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
`params-name` | string | — | Name of variable in `data['params']` to display.
`presentation-type` | string | `'f'` | Number display format. If `presentation-type` is `'sigfig'`, each number is formatted using the `to_precision` module to `digits` significant figures.  Otherwise, each number is formatted as `'{:.{digits}{presentation-type}}'`.
`digits` | integer | `"2"` | Number of digits to display according to the choice of `presentation-type`


#### Details

The variable in `data['params']` must be a scalar or 2D numpy array of numbers.

If the variable is a scalar, `pl-matrix-latex` returns the scalar as a string not wrapped in brackets.

If the variable is a numpy 2D array, `pl-matrix-latex` returns a string with the format:
    ` \begin{bmatrix} ... & ... \\ ... & ... \end{bmatrix}`

For example, if we want to display the following matrix operations
```
x = [A][b] + [c]
```
we write

```html
${\bf x} = <pl-matrix-latex params-name="A" digits="1"></pl-matrix-latex>
<pl-matrix-latex params-name="b" digits="1"></pl-matrix-latex>
+ <pl-matrix-latex params-name="c" digits="0"></pl-matrix-latex>$
