In the question panel, a `pl-matrix-input` element displays an input field that accepts a matrix (i.e., a 2-D array) expressed either in matlab or python format.

Here is an example of valid MATLAB format:
```
[1.23; 4.56]
```

Here is an example of valid python format:
```
[[1.23], [4.56]]
```

A scalar will be accepted either as a matrix of size $1\times 1$ (e.g., `[1.23]` or `[[1.23]]`) or just as a single number (e.g., `1.23`).

In the answer panel, a `pl-matrix-input` element displays the correct answer, allowing the user to switch between matlab and python format.

In the submission panel, a `pl-matrix-input` element displays either the submitted answer (in the same format that it was submitted, either matlab or python), or a note that the submitted answer was invalid (with an explanation of why).

## `pl-matrix-output` element

```html
<pl-matrix-output digits="3">
    <variable params_name="A">A</variable>
    <variable params_name="B">B</variable>
</pl-matrix-output>
```

Attributes for `<pl-matrix-output`:

Attribute | Type | Default | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
`digits` | integer | — | Number of digits to display after the decimal.

Attributes for `<variable>` (one of these for each variable to display):

Attribute | Type | Default | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
`params_name` | string | — | Name of variable in `data['params']` to display.

This element displays a list of variables inside `<pre>` tags that are formatted for import into either MATLAB or python (the user can switch between the two). Each variable must be either a scalar or a 2D numpy array (expressed as a list). Each variable will be prefixed by the text that appears between the `<variable>` and `</variable>` tags, followed by ` = `.

Here is an example of MATLAB format:
```
A = [1.23; 4.56];
```

Here is an example of python format:
```
import numpy as np

A = np.array([[1.23], [4.56]])
```

If a variable `v` is a complex object, you should use `import prairielearn as pl` and `data['params'][params_name] = pl.to_json(v)`.


## `pl-figure` element

```html
<!-- show a figure from an existing file -->
<pl-figure file_name="figure.png" directory="clientFilesCourse"></pl-figure>

<!-- show a figure from a file that is generated by code -->
<pl-figure file_name="figure.png" type="dynamic"></pl-figure>
```

Attribute | Type | Default | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
`file_name` | string | — | Name of image file.
`type` | text | 'static' | Type of file, either 'static' (an existing file) or 'dynamic' (a file generated by element or server code).
`directory` | text | "clientFilesQuestion" | The directory that contains the file, either 'clientFilesQuestion' or 'clientFilesCourse' (see [client and server files](clientServerFiles.md)). A directory cannot be specified if `type='dynamic'`.
`width` | number | `None` | Width of image (e.g., '250px').

If `type="dynamic"`, then the contents of the image file must be returned by a function `file()` that is located either in element code or in `server.py`. The contents must be a string (with utf-8 encoding), a bytes-like object, or a file-like object. The filename will be available to this function as `data['filename']`. For example, this code might appear in `server.py` to generate a file called `figure.png`:

```python
def file(data):
    if data['filename']=='figure.png':
        plt.plot([1,2,3],[3,4,-2])
        buf = io.BytesIO()
        plt.savefig(buf,format='png')
        return buf
```

If `file()` does not return anything, it will be treated as if `file()` returned the empty string.

## `pl-file-download` element

```html
<!-- allow students to download an existing file -->
<pl-file-download file_name="data.txt" directory="clientFilesCourse"></pl-file-download>

<!-- allow students to download a file that is generated by code -->
<pl-file-download file_name="data.txt" type="dynamic"></pl-file-download>
```

Attribute | Type | Default | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
`file_name` | string | — | Name of file to download.
`label` | text | file_name | Alternate text for file download link (e.g., `label="click here to download"`).
`type` | text | "static" | Type of file, either "static" (an existing file) or "dynamic" (a file generated by element or server code).
`directory` | text | "clientFilesQuestion" | The directory that contains the file, either "clientFilesQuestion" or "clientFilesCourse" (see [client and server files](clientServerFiles.md)). A directory cannot be specified if `type="dynamic"`.

If `type="dynamic"`, then the contents of the file must be returned by a function `file()` that is located either in element code or in `server.py`. The contents must be a string (with utf-8 encoding), a bytes-like object, or a file-like object. The filename will be available to this function as `data['filename']`. For example, this code might appear in `server.py` to generate a file called `data.txt`:

```python
def file(data):
    if data['filename']=='data.txt':
        return 'This data is generated by code.'
```

If `file()` does not return anything, it will be treated as if `file()` returned the empty string.

    <pl-threejs-stl file_name="MAKE_Robot_V6.stl" frame="body" scale="0.025" position="[-1,1,2]" orientation="[0,0,30]"></pl-threejs-stl>
    <pl-threejs-txt frame="body" position="[-1,1,2.6]" orientation="[0,0,30]">mini-me</pl-threejs-txt>
</pl-threejs>
```

This element displays a 3D scene with objects that the student can (optionally) translate and/or rotate. It can be used only for output (e.g., as part of a question that asks for something else to be submitted). Or, it can be used for input (e.g., comparing a submitted pose of the body-fixed objects to a correct orientation). Information about the current pose can be hidden from the student and, if visible, can be displayed in a variety of formats, so the element can be used for many different types of questions.

Attribute | Type | Default | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
`answer_name` | string | — | Variable name to store data in.
`body_position` | list | [0, 0, 0] | Initial position of body as `[x, y, z]`.
`body_orientation` | list | special | Initial orientation of body. Defaults to zero orientation (body frame aligned with space frame). Interpretation depends on `body_pose_format`.
`camera_position` | list | [5, 2, 2] | Initial position of camera as `[x, y, z]`.
`body_cantranslate` | boolean | true | If you can translate the body in the UI.
`body_canrotate` | boolean | true | If you can rotate the body in the UI.
`camera_canmove` | boolean | true | If you can move the camera (i.e., change the view) in the UI.
`body_pose_format` | string | rpy | Determines how `body_orientation` is interpreted. If `rpy` then `[roll, pitch, yaw]`. If `matrix` then 3x3 rotation matrix `[[...], [...], [...]]`. If `quaternion` then `[x, y, z, w]`. If `axisangle` then `[x, y, z, theta]` where `x, y, z` are coordinates of axis and `theta` is angle.
`answer_pose_format` | string | rpy | Determines how the answer `data['correct_answer'][answer_name]` is interpreted. If `homogeneous`, then the answer must be a 4x4 homogeneous transformation matrix `[[...], [...], [...], [...]]`. Otherwise, the answer must be a list with two elements. The first element must describe position as `[x, y, z]`. The second element must describe orientation, interpreted based on `answer_pose_format`. If `rpy` then `[roll, pitch, yaw]`. If `matrix` then 3x3 rotation matrix `[[...], [...], [...]]`. If `quaternion` then `[x, y, z, w]`. If `axisangle` then `[x, y, z, theta]` where `x, y, z` are coordinates of axis and `theta` is angle.
`text_pose_format` | string | matrix | Determines how the pose of the body is displayed as text. If `matrix` then position is `[x, y, z]` and orientation is a 3x3 rotation matrix. If `quaternion` then position is `[x, y, z]` and orientation is `[x, y, z, w]`. If `homogeneous` then pose is a 4x4 homogeneous transformation matrix.
`show_pose_in_question` | boolean | true | If the current pose of the body is displayed in the question panel.
`show_pose_in_correct_answer` | boolean | true | If the current pose of the body is displayed in the correct answer panel.
`show_pose_in_submitted_answer` | boolean | true | If the current pose of the body is displayed in the submitted answer panel.
`tol_position` | float | 0.5 | Error in position must be no more than this for the answer to be marked correct.
`tol_rotation` | float | 5.0 | Error in rotation must be no more than this for the answer to be marked correct.
`grade` | boolean | true | If the element will be graded, i.e., if it is being used to ask a question. If `grade` is `false`, then this element will never produce any html in the answer panel or in the submission panel.

A `pl-threejs-txt` element inside a `pl-threejs` element allows you to add whatever text appears between the `<pl-threejs-txt> ... </pl-threejs-txt>` tags as a mesh to the scene, and has these attributes:
