## `pl_file_download` element

```html
<!-- allow students to download an existing file -->
<pl_file_download file_name="data.txt" directory="clientFilesCourse" />

<!-- allow students to download a file that is generated by code -->
<pl_file_download file_name="data.txt" type="dynamic" />
```

Attribute | Type | Default | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
`file_name` | string | — | Name of file to download.
`label` | text | file_name | Alternate text for file download link (e.g., `label="click here to download"`).
`type` | text | "static" | Type of file, either "static" (an existing file) or "dynamic" (a file generated by element or server code).
`directory` | text | "clientFilesQuestion" | The directory that contains the file, either "clientFilesQuestion" or "clientFilesCourse" (see [client and server files](clientServerFiles.md)). A directory cannot be specified if `type="dynamic"`.

If `type="dynamic"`, then the contents of the file must be returned by a function `file()` that is located either in element code or in `server.py`. The contents must be a string (with utf-8 encoding), a bytes-like object, or a file-like object. The filename will be available to this function as `data['filename']`. For example, this code might appear in `server.py` to generate a file called `data.txt`:

```python
def file(data):
    if data['filename']=='data.txt':
        return 'This data is generated by code.'
```

If `file()` does not return anything, it will be treated as if `file()` returned the empty string.
