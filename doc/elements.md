Attribute | Type | Default | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
`correct` | boolean | false | Is this a correct answer to the question?

Two grading methods are available when using `partial-credit="true"`:

* 'EDC' (Every Decision Counts): in this method, the checkbox answers are considered as a list of true/false answers.  If `n` is the total number of answers, each answer is assigned `1/n` points. The total score is the summation of the points for every correct answer selected and every incorrect answer left unselected.

* 'PC' (Percent Correct): in this method, 1 point is added for each correct answer that is marked as correct and 1 point is subtracted for each incorrect answer that is marked as correct. The final score is the resulting summation of points divided by the total number of correct answers. The minimum final score is set to zero.

Correct answers are best created as `sympy` expressions and converted to json using:
```python
import prairielearn as pl
import sympy

def generate(data):
    sympy.var('x y')
    data['correct_answer']['ans'] = pl.to_json(x + y + 1)
```
It is also possible to specify the correct answer simply as a string, e.g., `x + y + 1`.

Do not include `i` or `j` in the list of `variables` if `allow-complex="true"`. Do not include any other reserved name in your list of `variables` (`e`, `pi`, `cos`, `sin`, etc.) The element code will check for (and disallow) conflicts between your list of `variables` and reserved names.

`digits` | integer | 2 | number of digits that must be correct for `comparison="sigfig"` or `comparison="decdig"`.
`allow-complex` | boolean | False | Whether or not to allow complex numbers as answers. If the correct answer `ans` is a complex object, you should use `import prairielearn as pl` and `data['correct_answer'][answers-name] = pl.to_json(ans)`.

In the question panel, a `pl-matrix-input` element displays an input field that accepts a matrix (i.e., a 2-D array) expressed either in matlab or python format.

Here is an example of valid MATLAB format:
```
[1.23; 4.56]
```

Here is an example of valid python format:
```
[[1.23], [4.56]]
```

A scalar will be accepted either as a matrix of size $1\times 1$ (e.g., `[1.23]` or `[[1.23]]`) or just as a single number (e.g., `1.23`).

In the answer panel, a `pl-matrix-input` element displays the correct answer, allowing the user to switch between matlab and python format.

In the submission panel, a `pl-matrix-input` element displays either the submitted answer (in the same format that it was submitted, either matlab or python), or a note that the submitted answer was invalid (with an explanation of why).

## `pl-matrix-output` element

```html
<pl-matrix-output digits="3">
    <variable params-name="A">A</variable>
    <variable params-name="B">B</variable>
</pl-matrix-output>
```

Attributes for `<pl-matrix-output`:

Attribute | Type | Default | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
`digits` | integer | — | Number of digits to display after the decimal.

Attributes for `<variable>` (one of these for each variable to display):

Attribute | Type | Default | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
`params-name` | string | — | Name of variable in `data['params']` to display.

This element displays a list of variables inside `<pre>` tags that are formatted for import into either MATLAB or python (the user can switch between the two). Each variable must be either a scalar or a 2D numpy array (expressed as a list). Each variable will be prefixed by the text that appears between the `<variable>` and `</variable>` tags, followed by ` = `.

Here is an example of MATLAB format:
```
A = [1.23; 4.56];
```

Here is an example of python format:
```
import numpy as np

A = np.array([[1.23], [4.56]])
```

If a variable `v` is a complex object, you should use `import prairielearn as pl` and `data['params'][params-name] = pl.to_json(v)`.


## `pl-matrix-latex` element

```html
<pl-matrix-latex params-name="A"></pl-matrix-latex>
```

Attribute | Type | Default | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
`params-name` | string | — | Name of variable in `data['params']` to display.
`presentation-type` | string | `'f'` | Number display format. If `presentation-type` is `'sigfig'`, each number is formatted using the `to_precision` module to `digits` significant figures.  Otherwise, each number is formatted as `'{:.{digits}{presentation-type}}'`.
`digits` | integer | `"2"` | Number of digits to display according to the choice of `presentation-type`

The variable in `data['params']` must be a scalar or 2D numpy array of numbers.

If the variable is a scalar, `pl-matrix-latex` returns the scalar as a string not wrapped in brackets.

If the variable is a numpy 2D array, `pl-matrix-latex` returns a string with the format:
    ` \begin{bmatrix} ... & ... \\ ... & ... \end{bmatrix}`


For example, if we want to display the following matrix operations
```
x = [A][b] + [c]
```
we write

```html
${\bf x} = <pl-matrix-latex params-name="A" digits="1"></pl-matrix-latex>
<pl-matrix-latex params-name="b" digits="1"></pl-matrix-latex>
+ <pl-matrix-latex params-name="c" digits="0"></pl-matrix-latex>$
```

`allow-feedback` | boolean | `allow-partial-credit` | Whether or not to allow feedback indicating which matrix components are incorrect. The default value of `allow-feedback` is the value of `allow-partial-credit`.

In the question panel, a `pl-matrix-component-input` element displays a grid of input fields with the same shape of the variable stored in `answers-name` (only 2D arrays of real numbers can be stored in `answers-name`). The question will only be graded when all matrix components are entered.


## `pl-figure` element

```html
<!-- show a figure from an existing file -->
<pl-figure file-name="figure.png" directory="clientFilesCourse"></pl-figure>

<!-- show a figure from a file that is generated by code -->

```

Attribute | Type | Default | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
`file-name` | string | — | Name of image file.

`directory` | text | "clientFilesQuestion" | The directory that contains the file, either 'clientFilesQuestion' or 'clientFilesCourse' (see [client and server files](clientServerFiles.md)). A directory cannot be specified if `type='dynamic'`.
`width` | number | `None` | Width of image (e.g., '250px').

If `type="dynamic"`, then the contents of the image file must be returned by a function `file()` that is located either in element code or in `server.py`. The contents must be a string (with utf-8 encoding), a bytes-like object, or a file-like object. The filename will be available to this function as `data['filename']`. For example, this code might appear in `server.py` to generate a file called `figure.png`:

```python
def file(data):
    if data['filename']=='figure.png':
        plt.plot([1,2,3],[3,4,-2])
        buf = io.BytesIO()
        plt.savefig(buf,format='png')
        return buf
```

If `file()` does not return anything, it will be treated as if `file()` returned the empty string.

</pl-threejs>
```

This element displays a 3D scene with objects that the student can (optionally) translate and/or rotate. It can be used only for output (e.g., as part of a question that asks for something else to be submitted). Or, it can be used for input (e.g., comparing a submitted pose of the body-fixed objects to a correct orientation). Information about the current pose can be hidden from the student and, if visible, can be displayed in a variety of formats, so the element can be used for many different types of questions.

Attribute | Type | Default | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
`answer-name` | string | — | Variable name to store data in.
`body-position` | list | [0, 0, 0] | Initial position of body as `[x, y, z]`.
`body-orientation` | list | special | Initial orientation of body. Defaults to zero orientation (body frame aligned with space frame). Interpretation depends on `body-pose-format`.
`camera-position` | list | [5, 2, 2] | Initial position of camera as `[x, y, z]`.
`body-cantranslate` | boolean | true | If you can translate the body in the UI.
`body-canrotate` | boolean | true | If you can rotate the body in the UI.
`camera-canmove` | boolean | true | If you can move the camera (i.e., change the view) in the UI.
`body-pose-format` | string | rpy | Determines how `body-orientation` is interpreted. If `rpy` then `[roll, pitch, yaw]`. If `matrix` then 3x3 rotation matrix `[[...], [...], [...]]`.

`answer-pose-format` | string | rpy | Determines how the answer `data['correct_answer'][answer-name]` is interpreted. If `homogeneous`, then the answer must be a 4x4 homogeneous transformation matrix `[[...], [...], [...], [...]]`. Otherwise, the answer must be a list with two elements. The first element must describe position as `[x, y, z]`. The second element must describe orientation, interpreted based on `answer-pose-format`. If `rpy` then `[roll, pitch, yaw]`. If `matrix` then 3x3 rotation matrix `[[...], [...], [...]]`. If `quaternion` then `[x, y, z, w]`. If `axisangle` then `[x, y, z, theta]` where `x, y, z` are coordinates of axis and `theta` is angle.
`text-pose-format` | string | matrix | Determines how the pose of the body is displayed as text. If `matrix` then position is `[x, y, z]` and orientation is a 3x3 rotation matrix. If `quaternion` then position is `[x, y, z]` and orientation is `[x, y, z, w]`. If `homogeneous` then pose is a 4x4 homogeneous transformation matrix.
`show-pose-in-question` | boolean | true | If the current pose of the body is displayed in the question panel.
`show-pose-in-correct-answer` | boolean | true | If the current pose of the body is displayed in the correct answer panel.
