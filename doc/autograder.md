# Autograder Configuration

This guide assumes that PrairieLearn is running locally. AWS is not supported yet.

## The Autograding Process

PrairieLearn autograding is set up to enable courses to use their existing grading infrastructure. All autograding jobs will be run in self-contained Docker containers (basically a lightweight VM) that they will be able to configure to their course's specifications.

Autograding configuration is split into three components: environments, autograders, and tests. All of these are specified via files to go along with the PrairieLearn pattern of configuration by files and directories named by convention.

An environment specifies the environment in which your autograder is run, and is specified with a [Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/). That Dockerfile can specify additional dependencies, compilers, etc. that your autograder may require to run. We will use that Dockerfile to build a Docker image, which we will then use to execute your test cases.

An autograder is a set of files that can be included in a question's test. If you have an autograder suite (for instance, CS 225's Monad) that relies on a large number of unchanging files, you can specify those in an autograder to avoid having to duplicate them in each autograded question.

Each autograded question should contain a directory called `tests` that contains any files that are specific to that test. If you specify any autograder for a question, you don't need to duplicate those files in your `tests` directory.

When we recieve a new question to autograde, will will set up a temporary directory. That directory will then have two subdirectories, `shared` and `student`. We will first copy your autograder files (if one is specified) into `shared`. We will then copy files in `tests` to `shared` as well, overwriting files if needed. Any code that the student submits will be copied into `student`. When we launch a container for your grading job, this directory will be mounted as `/grade`.

Your Dockerfile should specify a command that will be run to run your tests; typically, this will be a shell script that will copy files, set up users, do any additional configuration, and finally run your test suite. For instance, in the example course, the `python-main` environment has the script `init.sh`. As part of the build process, it copies that file into the root of the image and then specifies the command `CMD /init.sh`; that script then runs another script that is specifies in the python autograder.

Your autograder is responsible for writing the results of your tests into the file `/grade/results.json`; the format of that file is specified below. This format is standardized to allow for the reuse of this system between courses with different autograders.The contents of that file will be transmitted back to PrairieLearn to be saved and shown to the student.

## Directory layout

To use the autograder, the directory structure must be changed.

1. `tests` for each question
2. `autograders` that the course will use
3. `environment` folder that contains `DockerFiles` to setup the environment
4. `info.json` for each question much enable autograding

The following is an example of a well-structured course layout:

```
course
+-- questions           # all questions for the course (see other doc)
|   +-- addVector
|       `-- info.json           # autograding configuration goes here (see below)
|       `-- ...                 # some other question files
|       +-- tests               # folder of test cases
|           `-- ag.py       
            `-- soln_out.txt    # testing files
|        
|   
+-- autograders         # all autograders for the course
|   +-- ag1             # each set of autograder will be identified by its directory name
|       `-- file1       # some autograder files
|       `-- file2
|   +-- ag2
|       `-- ...
|
`-- environments        # files needed to configure the autograder environment
    +-- env1            # each environment will be identified by its directory name
    |   `-- Dockerfile
    |   `--.dockerignore
    |   `--init.sh          # Your Dockerfile should execute this file at the end to run your autograder
    +-- env2
```

## Enable Autograding per Question

The following fields must be added to each question's `info.json`:

```json
"autrogradingEnabled": true,
"environment": "prairielearn/centos7-base"
```

`environment` should correspond to a docker image on a container repository, and will be passed directly to AWS Batch as the `image` field in a job definition. See [here](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/job_definition_parameters.html) for more information. In the future, PrairieLearn will be able to automatically build and deploy the environments in your `environments/` directory; when that feature is added, we'll first check if your `environment` value corresponds to a directory in `environments/`. If it does, we'll build an image from that environment and use it to run your grading job; if not, we'll treat the value as a reference to an image on a container repository.

Additionally, you can specify an autograder with `"autograder": "ag1"`. If you specify an autograder `placeholder`, the files from `[course]/autograders/placeholder` will be present in `/grade/shared/` when your job is run.

If `autogradingEnabled` does not exist, autograding will be turned off by default.

## Grading Result

Your autograder must write a grading result to `/grade/results/results.json`. The result only has 2 mandatory fields: `testingCompleted` and `score`. `testingCompleted` indicates if the tests were able to run successfully, or if they failed due to a compiler or other error. `score` is the score, and should be a floating point number in the range [0.0, 1.0].

If you are using the example question, you can also add additional fields to give more feedback to students. An example `results.json` showing both the two mandatory fields and the additional fields is shown below.

```json
{
   "testingCompleted": "true",
   "score": 1,
   "message": "Tests completed successfully."
   "output": "Test 1 passed\nTest 2 passed\n...",
   "tests": [
      {
         "name": "test 1",
         "id": 0,
         "points": "1",
         "maxPoints": "1",
         "output": "Test 1 passed\n",
         "message": "No errors!"
      },
      ...
   ]
}
```

## Running locally for development

Autograding is handled by a service separate from PrairieLearn. In production, that service will be running on an EC2 instance, and potentially replicated across multiple EC2 instances. To make local development possible, PrairieLearn will replace AWS services with other solutions when running locally:

* Instead of using an SQS queue, PrairieLearn communicates with the autograder via a bidirectional socket; we've chosen to use port 3007 for this purpose.
* Instead of S3 storage, job files will be stored in `/jobs`. This directory should exist before running PrairieLearn or the autograder.

For this to work correctly, you have to launch the PrairieLearn docker container in a slightly different way than the default. First, you must mount `/jobs` as a volume. This will allow PrairieLearn to easily share files with the autograder. Second, you have to forward port 3007 from the container back to your machine. This allows PrairieLearn to pass messages to and from the autograder. So, your run command should look something like this:

```
docker run --rm -p 3000:3000 -p 3007:3007 -v /path/to/PrairieLearn:/PrairieLearn -v /jobs:/jobs prairielearn/prairielearn
```

After starting PrairieLearn, you should start the autograder. From the root of PrairieLearn:

```
$ cd autograder/mastergrader
$ node grader.js
```

The autograder will currently dump a bunch of messages and diagnostic output to the console; this is normal. If a grading run completes successfully, you'll see the `results.json` that the autograder generated being printed to the console.

The autograder currently builds a new image every time a new job is run; this is inefficent. In production, any new images should be built on top of an existing, saved image.

If you kill the autograder with SIGINT/SIGTERM, it will kill all running docker containers. This is undesirable behavior but was added to make developing the autograder easier. This will be changed in the future.

## Grading Job

NOTE: This is for documenting internal PrairieLearn behavior. This does not affect how autograders are run or developed, and will likely change.

The following format must be followed to send student files to the autograder:

```json
{
   "jobId": 49,
   "directory": "absolute/directory/to/top/level/directory",
   "courseName": "CS 251"
}
```
