              This is a <strong>multiple instance</strong> assessment, so each <%= identity %> may have more than one assessment instance.

The plain versions contain one record per <%= identity %>, which is taken to be the assessment instance for that <%= identity %> with the maximum percentage score. The <strong><code>_all</code></strong> CSV files contain one record per assessment instance, possibly including more than one record per student.
