  Upload a CSV file in the format of
  the <code><i>&lt;assessment&gt;</i>_submissions_for_manual_grading.csv</code>
  file from the Downloads page. See the
  <a href="https://prairielearn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/manualGrading/">Manual Grading documentation</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Alternatively, the CSV file can be in the format:
</p>
<pre class="ml-4">uid,instance,qid,score_perc,feedback
mwest@illinois.edu,1,addTwoNumbers,34.5,The second step was wrong
zilles@illinois.edu,1,matrixMultiply,100,Great job!
zilles@illinois.edu,1,addTwoNumbers,78.92,</pre>
<p>
  The <code>instance</code> column indicates which assessment instance
  to modify. The total scores for the assessments will be
  automatically recalculated. The feedback will be attached to the
  most recent student submission. To change the per-question points,
  replace the <code>score_perc</code> column above with
  a <code>points</code> column.
</p>
<p>
  By default the updates above change the manual portion of the grades
  for the instance question, in such a way that the sum of the new
  manual portion with the existing autograding portion matches the
  total listed in the <code>points</code> or <code>score_perc</code>
  columns above. It is, however, possible to replace these columns
  with <code>manual_points</code> and <code>auto_points</code>
  (or <code>manual_score_perc</code> and <code>auto_score_perc</code>)
  for more fine-tuned change of grade components.
