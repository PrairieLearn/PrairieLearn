# Desktop GUI Workspace

This image is using Ubuntu 20.04 and provides a desktop environment that users can access from a web browser. There are a few components that are running to get this working:

- XVFB (Creates a headless X11 server)
- x11vnc (Provides the VNC server)
- Websockify (Provides a TCP VNC -> Websocket layer)
- Custom Node server (Wraps the VNC stuff and serves the client pages)

## Building

`docker build . -t "prairielearn/workspace-desktop"`

## Workspace Options

```
"workspaceOptions": {
    "image": "prairielearn/workspace-desktop",
    "port": 8080,
    "home": "/home/prairielearner"
    ...
}
