# PrairieLearn RStudio workspace template
# 20210831 Eric Huber - Initial version
# 20240123 Eric Huber - Modify service file to provide server-user argument
# 20240127 Eric Huber - Pin base image, fix issues with the Nginx reverse proxy

# Maintainer notes:

# The s6 init system is part of the base image and we are working within its
# expectations. As a side effect of the unusual workarounds we are using to
# run as a limited user, it is normal to see s6 report some errors in the
# terminal log during startup, such as "unable to read status", "operation
# not permitted", "permission denied", "unable to chown", or "password not
# changed".

# If you want to test the proxy behavior locally, you should build a local
# copy of the image and set PL to not pull workspace images, using
# "workspacePullImagesFromDockerHub": false in config.json. Then, access a
# question referencing the image through your local PL session. If you want
# to test https mode, more info here:
# https://github.com/PrairieLearn/PrairieLearn/discussions/8897

# Trying to directly access the reverse proxy outside of the PL context may
# not work due to CORS issues.

# This image also MUST be tested in a question on the PrairieLearn site
# before deploying it to students. You can push and sync a separate tag on
# Docker Hub for testing without disrupting the official PL image.

# Set up your question with these options in info.json, editing the "image"
# parameter if you are using a custom image build for testing:

#    "workspaceOptions": {
#        "image": "prairielearn/workspace-rstudio",
#        "port": 3939,
#        "args": "",
#        "rewriteUrl": false,
#        "home": "/home/rstudio/workspace"
#    }

# If you just want to use RStudio locally for its own sake:
# $ docker build -t rstudio-local .
# $ docker run -it --rm -u 1001:1001 -p 127.0.0.1:8787:8787 rstudio-local
# And then open your browser to: http://localhost:8787/
# However, you could use the Rocker base images in that case.
# Their site has more documentation.

# Please read the note here carefully to avoid wiping out what you installed
# in ~/.local:

# EDITOR_FOCUS_DIR should be set to the directory you want the editor to start
# up in. This is not necessarily the same as the "home" setting in the
# question's info.json file. The "home" setting determines the mount point for
# the persistent cloud storage, which will hide any contents your image
# originally had at the same path. You might want to set both EDITOR_FOCUS_DIR
# and "home" to a deeper directory than /home/rstudio if you want to keep the
# default home contents from the workspace image (~/.local, etc.). For
# example, using /home/rstudio/workspace will copy the question's workspace
# folder contents into an empty mount at /home/rstudio/workspace and save it for
# the student, while always reusing the initial contents of /home/rstudio that
# you prepared in the image. (However, if students try to customize their
# editor settings, those will get reset in between sessions this way.)

USER rstudio
ENV EDITOR_FOCUS_DIR "/home/rstudio/workspace"
RUN mkdir -p "$EDITOR_FOCUS_DIR"

# The .Rprofile hack will set the working directory of the left code panes but
# not the right file browser pane. The rsession.conf hack below will set both.
# Keeping the setting out of the home directory also helps if you intend to
# mount the persisted storage there (which shadows whatever is in the image).
### The .Rprofile hack: (not used currently)
# USER rstudio
# RUN echo "setwd('$EDITOR_FOCUS_DIR')" >> "/home/rstudio/.Rprofile"
