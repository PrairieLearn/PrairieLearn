# This Nginx reverse proxy configuration is intended for the RStudio
# PrairieLearn workspace environment. We rewrite the base URL and handle some
# URL changes needed to deal with quirks of RStudio Server: It does not let
# us set the base URL directly yet, and it always redirects to a fake auth
# page on first load to set a cookie, even when we are running in the
# container without auth. The roundtrip through that auth page causes
# problems with proxying.

# Edited by: 20240127 Eric Huber - Fixing issues with the login redirect
# getting stuck again and removing the use of a cookie to set a flag. Instead
# we can detect when running on PL and make a targeted decision.

# Much of the preamble in this template was based on the default nginx.conf
# file included with Nginx, which is distributed under the following license,
