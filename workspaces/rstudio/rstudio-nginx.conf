# This Nginx reverse proxy configuration is intended for the RStudio
# PrairieLearn workspace environment. We rewrite the base URL (since RStudio
# Server does not have this feature yet), as well as pinning the scheme on
# the URL in a way necessary to support both local testing over HTTP and
# deployment on PL, where the PL server uses HTTPS, but internally the
# container uses HTTP.

# The original template was based on the default nginx.conf file included
# with Nginx, which is distributed under the following license, as found at
# the URL: https://nginx.org/LICENSE
