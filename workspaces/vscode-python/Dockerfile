# Run the rest of the build commands in a bash shell in login mode so that
# conda/mamba shell hooks will work. This also allows images derived from
# this one to add "RUN pip install" commands without trouble. To complete
# this setup, we also must run mamba init with --system after mamba is
# installed, as a separate step below.
