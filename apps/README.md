The main source code for the PrairieLearn project can be found in the [`prairielearn`](prairielearn/) directory.

The [`grader-host`](./grader-host/) is the production version of the grading process, with the development version running directly inside of PrairieLearn by default. The [`workspace-host`](./workspace-host/) runs in both production and development.
