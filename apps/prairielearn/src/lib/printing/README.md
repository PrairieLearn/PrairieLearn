# Printing

Tools for creating printable PDFs and editable Word documents, plus a helper that keeps question IDs unique when separate questions share a page.

## Rendering PDFs and Word documents

The browser lays out questions and splits them into pages. PDFs use the finished pages. Word documents use question content saved before page breaks are added, along with images of figures. Create one renderer per application process:

```ts
import { config } from './config.js';
import { PrintRenderer } from './printing/print-renderer.js';

const renderer = new PrintRenderer({
  cloudflare:
    config.printingCloudflareAccountId && config.printingCloudflareApiToken
      ? {
          accountId: config.printingCloudflareAccountId,
          apiToken: config.printingCloudflareApiToken,
        }
      : undefined,
});
const pdf = await renderer.renderPdf({
  url: previewUrl,
  browserOrigin: config.serverCanonicalHost ?? undefined,
  html: paginatedHtml,
  assetScope,
});
await renderer.close(); // during shutdown
```

Build `assetScope` from the already authorized course instance, assessment, assessment instance, selected instance question IDs, and user IDs. The renderer uses it to mint a credential for that render.

The renderer connects to one Cloudflare browser on first use and runs up to four independent contexts concurrently. Another 64 requests may wait. HTTP print requests share a 45-second deadline across question preparation, queueing, and rendering. Local development uses one Chromium render at a time and a queue of 16. Set `maxConcurrentRenders` or `maxQueuedRenders` to override those limits. Each render has its own short-lived context. A browser that disconnects is reconnected on the next render, and `close()` rejects queued renders and closes the browser.

Set both `printingCloudflareAccountId` and `printingCloudflareApiToken` on every server that handles print requests to use Cloudflare Browser Run. If both are unset, the renderer uses local Chromium. A missing or empty value in either setting is a configuration error. The token needs Browser Run Edit permission. Without Cloudflare credentials, a Playwright-compatible Chromium executable must be installed locally for development and tests.

Cloudflare renders require an explicit `browserOrigin`; a missing or empty value fails before connecting to the browser. In production, pass the application's public origin from `config.serverCanonicalHost`. The Cloudflare browser loads public files under `config.assetsPrefix` directly from that origin. Protected assets are fetched from the application server's local listener and fulfilled through Playwright.

Cloudflare development also requires `config.serverCanonicalHost` to be configured. The renderer fulfills navigation with the supplied HTML and proxies all assets to the application server, so Cloudflare does not need to reach the local server. Local Chromium ignores `browserOrigin` and uses `url` directly.

Set `runScripts: true` when preparing a fresh preview from server-generated question HTML. PDF exports use the completed, script-free page snapshot with scripts disabled. Keep scripts enabled when collecting Word content from a fresh preview so the page can save it before pagination.

For each render with `assetScope`, the renderer issues a five-minute, job-specific asset credential. It permits only public assets and protected asset paths for that assessment instance and its selected instance questions. It sends the credential to the local asset routes, never to the rendering browser. Other same-origin routes, proxied redirects, mutating requests, cross-origin requests, service workers, WebSockets, and socket.io polling are blocked. Direct public asset requests may follow redirects using the browser's normal behavior, without a credential. Cross-origin question assets must be served through PrairieLearn to appear in the output.

The caller owns the paginated HTML page. It must set `document.documentElement.dataset.printStatus` to `ready` after Paged.js finishes, or to `error` with a `data-print-error` message if pagination fails. The page's CSS `@page` rule is authoritative for the physical paper size.

For outputs that also need metadata from the paginated page, use `renderer.render(options, output)` with a custom `PrintablePageOutput`. Its `produce(page)` callback can inspect the DOM and then call `createPdfOutput().produce(page)` to reuse the standard PDF output.

### Word output

Word documents keep text, lists, tables, answer spaces, links, and equations editable when possible. Images, SVG diagrams, and canvases appear as pictures. Some equations also appear as pictures when no editable version is available.

Word can rearrange pages after edits, so its page count may differ from the PDF. Paper size and margins match the printable page. Details boxes keep their headings and content. Response guidance appears below the answer line, while labels and units stay beside it.

The browser saves question text and equations before it splits them into pages, then captures figures once the page layout is complete. `createDocxDocument` turns that content into an editable Word document. The cover and footer stay editable; callers supply them through `PrintableCover` and `footerLabel`.

`cover` may also be a function. It receives the page's root `data-*` attributes, so values known only after rendering, such as the number of questions that rendered successfully, can appear on the cover.

`htmlToTextBlocks` turns HTML content, such as assessment instructions, into headings, paragraphs, and simple lists for the cover, preserving bold, italics, underline, strikethrough, code, subscripts, and superscripts from HTML tags.

Omit the `cover` option to start with questions on the first page.

### PrairieLearn endpoint parameters

`document=assessment` selects the student-facing document and is the default when omitted. Use `document=answer_key` to include correct answers.

The PrairieLearn print endpoint accepts layout choices as query parameters. `block_size` sets the default for every question to `auto`, `third`, `half`, or `full`; it defaults to `auto` when omitted. Repeat `question_block_size=<question-number>:<size>` to override individual questions. Repeat `identity_field=<label>` to add up to six fill-in lines to the cover alongside its built-in Name field. Identity labels are trimmed and may contain up to 40 characters.

`form_label=A` through `form_label=Z` gives an assessment instance a short label on its cover and footers. Omitting it preserves the assessment instance's existing numeric Form ID label.

`include_cover=false` omits the default cover in previews, PDFs, and Word downloads, including answer keys. The default is `true`.

`include_honor_code=true` or `false` controls the student cover pledge independently of the online assessment requirement. Omitting it uses the assessment’s `requireHonorCode` setting. The printed pledge uses the configured `honorCode` when present, with a blank name line for `{{user_name}}`; otherwise it uses the standard pledge.

`grading_table=true` adds blank question scores and a total to student covers. The table uses only included questions and fills down the available cover space before wrapping to another column.

Automatic blocks are measured at the final printable width after asynchronous question content, MathJax, fonts, and images have settled, then packed in question order. Explicit blocks reserve an exact fraction of the printable content height, including the question's internal spacing, when the content fits. Taller content uses its measured height and moves to the next page or flows across pages when needed.

For example, this gives every question automatic sizing except Questions 2 and 5:

```text
?paper_size=Letter&question_block_size=2:half&question_block_size=5:full
```

This sets a half-page default and allows Question 3 to size itself automatically:

```text
?paper_size=A4&block_size=half&question_block_size=3:auto
```

## Combining question fragments

Questions are normally rendered in separate documents, so author-generated IDs can repeat between questions. Before combining fragments in a preview or print document, call `namespaceQuestionHtmls` with a stable, unique namespace for each question and await its result. It renames IDs repeated across fragments and supported references in the rendered HTML: ID-reference attributes, inline `style` attributes and `<style>` blocks, and literal `getElementById`, `querySelector`, `querySelectorAll`, `closest`, `matches`, and `$` calls in inline scripts.

The helper does not read external CSS or JavaScript files. IDs referenced from those files must be unique across the combined fragments. If an ID collides, the HTML ID is renamed but the external reference stays the same; the helper cannot detect or report the broken reference. Custom course elements remain best-effort for printable assessments, so preview the output before printing. It namespaces IDs repeated within a fragment inside each inline SVG and rewrites references inside that SVG. References outside an SVG to an ID repeated within the fragment remain ambiguous. Other duplicate IDs within one fragment, or any duplicate IDs left after namespacing, are rejected.
