  A major overhaul of manual grading features has just been deployed
  to all courses. Instructors and TAs now have more flexibility to
  grade question components manually, and to more easily review and
  provide feedback on students work.
</p>
<p>
  Assessment questions can now be assigned a combination of
  auto-graded and manual point components. This combination can be
  used in questions that require some level of human review, such as
  questions that require a description of the progress to arrive at
  the result ("show your work"), review of code style and comments in
  coding questions, or essay-type justification of student
  answers. Assessments can be set up to use this combination in
  individual questions:
</p>
<pre>
"zones": [
    {
        "title": "Manually graded questions",
        "questions": [
            {"id": "essayQ", "manualPoints": 10},
            {"id": "autoPlusManualQ", "autoPoints": 7, "manualPoints": 15},
        ]
    }
</pre>
<p>
  Additional details on this configuration can be found
  in <a href="https://prairielearn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/assessment/#question-specification"
  target="_blank">the PrairieLearn documentation</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Manual grading has also received a new user interface, in addition
  to the existing grade upload features. It is now possible to
  manually grade student submissions directly in the PrairieLearn user
  interface, allowing course staff to provide feedback on individual
  questions. This is done using the new "Manual Grading" tab in
  assessments. Graders can be assigned to grade individual questions,
  and can direct answers that require further clarification to head
  TAs or instructors. Students have a clearer view of which questions
  are graded automatically and which questions have been manually
  graded, and have access to the provided feedback.
</p>
<p>
  This manual grading process is a work in progress. There is
  currently ongoing work to provide more detailed and structured
  feedback through guided rubrics. Future changes are planned to also
  provide additional statistics related to manual grading results, as
  well as to improve the workflow for regrading requests.
