  A major overhaul of manual grading features has just been deployed to all courses. Instructors and
  TAs now have more flexibility to grade question components manually, and to more easily review and
  provide feedback on students work.
</p>
<p>
  Assessment questions can now be assigned a combination of auto-graded and manual point components.
  This combination can be used in questions that require some level of human review, such as
  questions that require a description of the progress to arrive at the result ("show your work"),
  review of code style and comments in coding questions, or essay-type justification of student
  answers. Assessments can be set up to use this combination in individual questions:
</p>
<pre>
"zones": [
    {
        "title": "Manually graded questions",
        "questions": [
            {"id": "essayQ", "manualPoints": 10},
            {"id": "autoPlusManualQ", "autoPoints": 7, "manualPoints": 15},
        ]
    }
</pre>
<p>

  >.
</p>
<p>
  Manual grading has also received a new user interface, in addition to the existing grade upload
  features. It is now possible to manually grade student submissions directly in the PrairieLearn
  user interface, allowing course staff to provide feedback on individual questions. This is done
  using the new "Manual Grading" tab in assessments. Graders can be assigned to grade individual
  questions, and can direct answers that require further clarification to head TAs or instructors.
  Students have a clearer view of which questions are graded automatically and which questions have
  been manually graded, and have access to the provided feedback.
</p>
<p>
  This manual grading process is a work in progress. There is currently ongoing work to provide more
  detailed and structured feedback through guided rubrics. Future changes are planned to also
  provide additional statistics related to manual grading results, as well as to improve the
  workflow for regrading requests.

  versions of this user interface and providing meaningful feedback.
