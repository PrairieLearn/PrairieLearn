  Thanks to the work of numerous contributors, the PrairieLearn development team is looking forward
  to introducing improvements in the instructor's experience for manually-graded questions in the
  coming months. As part of these improvements, manual grading feedback will be shown automatically
  to students, when available. If you have been using manual grading feedback, then you can remove
  references to <code>{{{feedback.manual}}}</code> from your questions to avoid showing this
  feedback twice. More details are below.
</p>
<p>
  One of the existing features of manual grading is the ability to provide open-ended feedback to
  students, which allows students to understand their misconceptions and improve their learning
  experience. This feedback is typically provided using
  <a
    href="https://prairielearn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/manualGrading/#uploading-the-scores-and-feedback"
    target="_blank"
    >the grade upload feature</a
  >, and so far required question creators to include it explicitly in the
  <code>question.html</code> file.
</p>
<p>
  Some upcoming features in manual grading will enable more detailed feedback options, which require
  changes in visual elements for the student's question view. In order to simplify some of these
  changes, the student's question page now shows manual grading feedback by default, in a separate
  panel, as shown below.
</p>
<p>
  <img
    src="manualGradingFeedback.png"
    class="border rounded w-75"
    alt="The feedback content is shown in a panel just above the submission panel."
  />
</p>
<p>
  One caveat of the change above is that, if the <code>question.html</code> file continues to
  include the feedback in the submission panel, then feedback will be shown to students twice, once
  in the new panel, and once where it was shown before. To avoid this duplication, instructors are
  strongly encouraged to remove any reference to the manual feedback text from their questions.
</p>
<p>
  For most instructors using manual feedback, the question will include a reference to
  <code>{{{feedback.manual}}}</code> somewhere in the question file. For reference, the manual
  grading documentation used to have the following snippet as a suggestion. You are encouraged to
  remove this snippet from your questions.
</p>
<pre class="border rounded bg-light p-2">
&lt;pl-submission-panel&gt;
  {{#feedback.manual}}
  &lt;p&gt;Feedback from course staff:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;markdown&gt;{{{feedback.manual}}}&lt;/markdown&gt;
  {{/feedback.manual}}
&lt;/pl-submission-panel&gt;
</pre>
