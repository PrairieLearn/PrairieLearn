  <a href="https://github.com/trombonekenny">Dave Mussulman</a> has implemented a new caching system
  for Docker images. These images are used by
  <a href="https://prairielearn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/externalGrading/"
    >externally-graded code questions</a
  >
  and <a href="https://prairielearn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/workspaces/">workspaces</a>. The new
  cache speeds up all image operations and also means that PrairieLearn can rapidly scale to handle
  bursts of load from external grading or workspaces.
</p>

<p>
  However, there is now a <span class="text-danger">required manual sync for Docker images</span>,
  just like syncing course code from GitHub. The new image sync is also on the "Sync" page and works
  like the GitHub sync:
</p>

<img src="images_sync.png" width="100%" />

<p>
  If you make your own image and push it to Docker Hub, you will now need to sync it to PrairieLearn
  before it can be used. The Docker image cache is global (not per-course) and the latest cached
  image version will be used at all times. If you want to use a specific image version then you can
  tag images and reference the specific tag.
</p>

<p>
  On the backend, the new image cache stores the images in the
  <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/">Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)</a>, which provides
  a private Docker registry with a highly available and scalable architecture.
