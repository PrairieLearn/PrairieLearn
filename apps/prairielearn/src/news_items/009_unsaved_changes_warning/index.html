  Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/tdy">Tim Yang</a>, PrairieLearn will now warn you if you
  forget to save an answer to a question before leaving the page.
</p>

<p>
  If you type an answer into a question but forget to "Save" or "Save & Grade" it, when you leave
  the page you'll get a pop-up warning like this:
</p>

<img src="prompt.png" width="600px" />

<p>
  You can either click "Leave" to keep going and discard your answer, or "Cancel" to go back to the
  page and save your answer. The exact form of this warning will depend on which web browser you
  use, and some browsers might not always show it.
</p>
