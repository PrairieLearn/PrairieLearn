  The layout of instructor pages and navigation bars has been massively improved by
  <a href="https://github.com/tbretl">Tim Bretl</a>.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Easy switching.</b> You can now quickly switch between different courses and different
  instances (semesters/terms) of a course. To do this, click on the downwards-pointing triangle to
  the right of the course name or instance name in the top navigation bar.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Shortcut tabs in the top menu bar.</b> All pages can be accessed from the second-level tab bar,
  but for commonly used pages like "Questions" and "Assessments" there are also shortcut buttons in
  the top navigation bar.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Wide view on instructor pages.</b> All instructor pages now use the full width of the web
  browser window. This is particularly helpful on pages like the Questions list, where there are
  many columns in a table. Student pages have not changed width and there is no plan to ever change
  this. When previewing a question in instructor mode, the width is fixed to the same as student
  view so questions always look the same for everyone.
