<p>
  The layout of instructor pages and navigation bars has been
  massively improved by <a href="https://github.com/tbretl">Tim
    Bretl</a>.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Easy switching.</b> You can now quickly switch between different
  courses and different instances (semesters/terms) of a course. To do
  this, click on the downwards-pointing triangle to the right of the
  course name or instance name in the top navigation bar.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Shortcut tabs in the top menu bar.</b> All pages can be accessed
  from the second-level tab bar, but for commonly used pages like
  "Questions" and "Assessments" there are also shortcut buttons in the
  top navigation bar.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Wide view on instructor pages.</b> All instructor pages now use
  the full width of the web browser window. This is particularly
  helpful on pages like the Questions list, where there are many
  columns in a table. Student pages have not changed width and there
  is no plan to ever change this. When previewing a question in
  instructor mode, the width is fixed to the same as student view so
  questions always look the same for everyone.
