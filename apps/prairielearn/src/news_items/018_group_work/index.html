  Thanks to a huge development effort led by
  <a href="https://github.com/frankyhao">Frankie Yuan</a> and
  <a href="https://github.com/zhining4">Zhining Qiu</a>
  PrairieLearn now supports group assessments. This lets students collaboratively work on an
  assessment together, with everyone in the group submitting answers to the same questions and
  everyone receiving the same shared scores.

  There is a flexible group assignment system that allows instructors to either assign students to
  groups (via CSV upload or randomly generated by PrairieLearn) or let students make their own
  groups.

  This new group assessment feature is ideal for discussion sections or labs where students are
  expected to work together on a sequence of problems. Groups are also good for in-class
  collaborative activities.
