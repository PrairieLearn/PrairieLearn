  <a href="https://github.com/jonatanschroeder">Jonatan Schroeder</a> continues his excellent work
  with another new feature! PrairieLearn now allows instructors to set a minimum time that students
  must wait between grading their answers to a question. For the student this looks like:
</p>

<p>
  <img src="gradeBlocked.png" />
</p>

<p>
  Saving answers is still allowed when a grading rate limit is in effect for a question, but the
  question can't be graded again until either the waiting time has elapsed, or when the assessment
  finishes.
</p>

<p>
  To configure a grading rate limit, set the <code>gradeRateMinutes</code> key in
  <code>infoAssessment.json</code>. This indicates how long a student needs to wait after grading a
  question to resubmit a new answer to the same question for grading and it can be set at different
  levels of the assessment, with lower levels overriding higher ones. For example:
</p>

<pre class="mb-3 rounded">
"zones": [
    {
        "gradeRateMinutes": 30,
        "questions": [
            {"id": "canOnlySubmitEvery30minutes", "points": 10},
            {"id": "canOnlySubmitEvery60minutes", "points": 10, "gradeRateMinutes": 60},
            {"id": "canSubmitAnytime", "points": 10, "gradeRateMinutes": 0}
        ]
    }
],
</pre>

<p>
  The motivation behind grading rate limits is to prevent mindless trial-and-error problem solving.
  While we know that practice is key for learning and that it's important to allow room for mistakes
  and repeated attempts, it's also valuable to compel students to evaluate, experiment and test
  their own work, and to encourage reflection and thinking between solution attempts. To achieve
  this, controlling resubmissions can be an effective tool (<a
