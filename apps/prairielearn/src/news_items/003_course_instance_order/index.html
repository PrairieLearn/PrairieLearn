  When a course has multiple <i>course instances</i> (semesters), PrairieLearn will now order them
  in reverse date order. This improvement is thanks to
  <a href="https://github.com/tbretl">Tim Bretl</a> and means that you should now see a sensible
  ordering like:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Spring 2020</li>
  <li>Fall 2019</li>
  <li>Spring 2019</li>
  <li>Fall 2018</li>
</ul>

<p>The most recent course instance should be first in the list and older ones are below.</p>

<p>
  <b>How exactly are they ordered?</b> The date used for ordering is the first-access date for each
  course instance. You can see this date by clicking on the course rubric (e.g., "TAM 212") in the
  top navigation bar and then selecting the "Course instances" tab. This date is determined from the
  <tt>infoCourseInstance.json</tt> files, where PrairieLearn uses the earliest <tt>startDate</tt> of
  any <tt>allowAccess</tt> rule. In case of ties between dates, the <tt>endDate</tt> is used as a
  tie breaker.
</p>

<p>
  <b>How did PrairieLearn used to order the course instances?</b>
  Before this change, PrairieLearn used a combination of an undocumented <tt>number</tt> field in
  the <tt>infoCourseInstance.json</tt> files and an internal database identifier. This often
  resulted in an apparently random order. The new order should be better in all cases, but do let us
  know if you encounter a bad ordering.
