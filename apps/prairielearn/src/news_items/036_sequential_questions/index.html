<p>
  Thanks to the work of <a href="https://astrosticks.com">David Mitchell</a> (Illinois CS),
  assessments can now be configured to force students to complete questions strictly in the order
  that they appear. For instructors who want to configure worksheets, labs, etc. where each question
  builds off of previous knowledge, this feature is for you.
</p>
<p>
  Adding the key <code>advanceScorePerc</code> with a value between 0 and 100 at any level of your
  <code>infoAssessment.json</code> config will cause all questions under that category to be locked
  until they have a submission that's correct to at least that percentage before allowing students
  to access later questions. If a student runs out of attempts on a question, the next question will
  unlock automatically. All the details are described in the
  <a
    href="https://prairielearn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/assessment/#forcing-students-to-complete-questions
  in-order"
    >PrairieLearn documentation</a
  >.
</p>

<p>
  As an example, this <code>infoAssessment.json</code> file will require that students get at least
  80% on each question (or run out of attempts) before they can proceed to the next question:
</p>
<pre class="border rounded bg-light p-2">
...
"zones": [
  {
    "advanceScorePerc": 80,
    "questions": [
      {"id": "demo/demoNewton-page1", "points": [3,2,1]},
      {"id": "demo/demoNewton-page2", "points": [3,2,1]}
    ]
  }
]
...
</pre>

<p>
  On the Assessment Overview page, students will initially see the above assessment with only
  Question 1 available. Question 2 will be locked:
</p>

<p>
  <img
    src="example1a.png"
    class="border rounded"
    title="An assessment where the first question is a link, and the second question is greyed out with a lock icon next to it."
  />
</p>

<p>To help students understand how these features work, informational tooltips are shown:</p>
<p>
  <img
    src="example1b.png"
    class="border rounded"
    title='Tooltip next to the lock icon: "You must score at least 80% on Question 1 to unlock this question."'
  />
</p>
<p class="mb-5">
  <img
    src="example1c.png"
    class="border rounded"
    title='Tooltip next to the "next question" button from inside of a question: "You must score at least 80% on this question to unlock the next. If you run out of attempts, the next question will unlock automatically."'
  />
</p>
