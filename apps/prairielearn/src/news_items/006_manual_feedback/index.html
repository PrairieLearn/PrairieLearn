  <a href="https://github.com/bowmnath">Nathan Bowman</a>, PrairieLearn now supports offline manual
  grading with feedback. See
  <a href="https://prairielearn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/manualGrading/">the documentation</a> for
  details, or read on below.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Step 1: Configure questions for manual grading.</b> To indicate that a particular question is
  manually graded, set <tt>"grading Method": "Manual"</tt> in the <tt>info.json</tt> file. It's a
  good idea to also set these questions to only use a single random variant per student.
  Manually-graded questions allow students to "Save" as many answer attempts as they want, but they
  don't have a "Save & Grade" button. The <tt>info.json</tt> file should look like:
</p>

<div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
  <div class="card mb-4" style="width: 50%">
    <div class="card-header">
      <tt>info.json</tt>
    </div>
    <div class="card-body">
      <pre class="mb-0">
{
    "uuid": "cbf5cbf2-6458-4f13-a418-aa4d2b1093ff",
    "gradingMethod": "Manual",
    "singleVariant": true,
    ...
}</pre
      >
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>
  To show manual feedback, the <tt>question.html</tt> file should contain an element to display the
  feedback next to student submissions. A basic template that uses Markdown is:
</p>

<div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
  <div class="card mb-4" style="width: 50%">
    <div class="card-header">
      <tt>question.html</tt>
    </div>
    <div class="card-body">
      <pre class="mb-0">
&lt;pl-submission-panel&gt;
  {{#feedback.manual}}
  &lt;p&gt;Feedback from course staff:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;markdown&gt;{{{feedback.manual}}}&lt;/markdown&gt;
  {{/feedback.manual}}
&lt;/pl-submission-panel&gt;</pre
      >
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>
  <b>Step 2: Download a CSV file with the student answers.</b> After students have completed the
  assessment, download
  <tt>&lt;assessment&gt;_submissions_for_manual_grading.csv</tt>
  from the "Downloads" tab. This file contains the student answers and other question information
  like random parameters. An example is shown below. If the students uploaded files then you can
  also download <tt>&lt;assessment&gt;_files_for_manual_grading.zip</tt>
  from the "Downloads" tab.
</p>

<div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
  <div class="card mb-4" style="max-width: 95%">
    <div class="card-header">
      <tt>&lt;assessment&gt;_submissions_for_manual_grading.csv</tt>
    </div>
    <a href="csv_for_grading.png"
      ><img
        src="csv_for_grading.png"
        alt="Screenshot of CSV for grading"
        class="card-img-top"
        style="max-width: 100%"
    /></a>
  </div>
</div>

<p>
  <b>Step 3: Fill in scores and feedback, and upload the CSV.</b> Fill in the last two empty columns
  in the CSV file, and then upload it on the "Uploads" tab for the assessment. That's it! You can
  leave either <tt>score_perc</tt> or <tt>feedback</tt> blank if you don't need it.
</p>
