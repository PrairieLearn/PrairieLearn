  Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/tdy">Tim Yang</a>, PrairieLearn exams now default to
  starting with an identity certification and honor code pledge:
</p>

<img src="honor_code.png" width="700px" />

<p>
  The "Start assessment" button is disabled until the student clicks the checkbox to "certify and
  pledge the above."
</p>

<p>
  You can remove the honor code by setting <tt>"requireHonorCode": false</tt> as a top-level option
  in the <tt>infoAssessment.json</tt>
  file. See
  <a href="https://prairielearn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/assessment/#honor-code"
    >the documentation</a
  >
  for details.
</p>

<p>
  The text of the honor code was based on the University of Maryland's
  <a href="https://www.studentconduct.umd.edu/honor-pledge">Honor Pledge</a> and the University of
  Rochester's
  <a href="https://www.rochester.edu/college/honesty/instructors/pledge.html"
    >Honor Pledge for Exams</a
  >. This is a "modified" honor code (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1014893102151"
    >McCabe et al., 2002</a
  >), as opposed to "traditional" codes that typically also require students to report any
  violations of the honor code they observe.
