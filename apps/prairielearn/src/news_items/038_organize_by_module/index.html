  You can now declare a list of course modules from your course configuration file. These are
  collections of assessments that can belong to different sets, which get displayed together in the
  order that you declare them. You can think of them as chapters, sections, or topic lists in your
  course. If you want to group together several types of assessments sets (for example, two
  homeworks and an exam), now you can!

  This organization selection is done at the course instance level. Thus you can sort some
  sections/semesters of your course by "Sets", and some others by "Modules". Visit the
