    A ladder 10 feet long rests against a vertical wall. If the bottom of the ladder slides away
    from the wall at a rate of $\frac{1}{4}$ feet per second, how quickly (in radians per second) is
    <b>the angle between the ladder and the wall</b> increasing when the bottom of the ladder is 6
    feet from the wall?
