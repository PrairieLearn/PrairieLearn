## Elements to create drawing canvas

### `pl-drawing` element

A `pl-drawing` element displays a canvas, which can be used to display initial drawing objects or expect drawing objects for grading.

The system of coordinates of the canvas is located at the top/left corner, as illustrated in the image below.

#### Sample element

```html
<pl-drawing answers-name="fbd">
</pl-drawing>
```
<img src="pl-drawing.png" width=70%>

#### Customizations

Attribute | Type | Default | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
`gradable` | boolean | false | `gradable = true` expects objects to be placed in the canvas for grading, when `gradable = false` the canvas will be used for display only, i.e. for plotting figures.
`answers-name` | string | — | Variable name to store student-input data in. This variable is required when `gradable = true`. The input data will be stored in `data[“submitted_answers”][answers-name]`.
`width` | integer | 580 | Horizontal width of the canvas (in pixels).
`height` | integer | 320 | Vertical height of the canvas (in pixels).
`grid-size` | integer | 20 | Size of the square grid for the canvas background (in pixels). If `grid-size = 0`, then the background is white.
`snap-to-grid` | boolean | false | If true, objects placed in the canvas snap to closest grid point. Otherwise, they can be placed outside of the grid.
`correct-answer` | string | special | Correct answer for grading. Defaults to `data["correct-answers"][answers-name]`.
`tol` | float | `0.5*grid-size` | Tolerance to check the position of objects (in pixels). The error is calculated as the absolute difference between expected position and submitted one.
`angle-tol` | float | 10 | Tolerance to check angles (in degrees). The error is calculated as the absolute difference between expected angle and submitted one.
`show-tolerance-hint` | boolean | true | Show tolerance hint under the canvas. The default is `true` when `gradable = true`.
`tolerance-hint` | text | "The expected tolerance is 1/2 square grid." | Hint explaining tolerance used when grading objects.
`disregard-extra-elements` | boolean | false | If true, extra elements are ignored if they match the same reference object.  Otherwise, multiple matching elements will reduce the awarded points.
`hide-answer-panel` | boolean | true | If true, the correct answer is not displayed in the answer panel. 


### `pl-drawing-initial` element

A `pl-drawing-initial` will group objects that will be displayed in the canvas defined by `pl-drawing`.

For example, `pl-drawing-initial` can be used to create figures that are displayed as part of the question body:

```html
<pl-drawing grid-size="0">
    <pl-drawing-initial>
        <!-- create the image here -->
    </pl-drawing-initial>
</pl-drawing>
```

<img src="pl-I.png" width=30%>

And `pl-drawing-initial` can also be used to display initial objects in a canvas that will be used for grading. Objects inside `pl-drawing-initial` are not graded. Objects inside `pl-drawing-answer` are  graded.

```html
<pl-drawing gradable="true" answers-name="add-objects">

    <pl-drawing-initial>
    <!-- objects that define the correct answer are placed here -->
    </pl-drawing-initial>
    <pl-drawing-answer>
      <!-- objects that define the correct answer are placed here -->
    </pl-drawing-answer>

</pl-drawing>
```

The child element `pl-drawing-answer` is explained below in the [Grading](#elements-to-set-up-a-grading-canvas) section.

## Elements to set up a grading canvas

### `pl-drawing-group` element

The element `pl-drawing-answer` is required when setting a drawing canvas for grading, but there are other elements as well that can be helpful. The example below illustrates typical parts of a grading canvas.

#### Sample element

```html
<pl-drawing grid-size="20" gradable="true" answers-name="box" width="320">

    <pl-drawing-answer draw-error-box="true">
        <pl-vector x1="160" y1="160"  angle="-45"></pl-vector>
    </pl-drawing-answer>

    <pl-drawing-initial>
        <pl-coordinates x1="160" y1="160" width="100" angle="0" label="A" offsetx=-20></pl-coordinates>
    </pl-drawing-initial>

    <pl-controls>
        <pl-controls-group label="Graded objects:" >
            <pl-drawing-button type="pl-vector"></pl-drawing-button>
        </pl-controls-group>
        <pl-controls-group label="Delete button:">
            <pl-drawing-button type="delete"></pl-drawing-button>
        </pl-controls-group>
    </pl-controls>
</pl-drawing>
```

<img src="pl-vector-grading-canvas-example.png" width=70%>


### `pl-drawing-answer` element

This element will wrap all the elements that will be graded (checked for correctness).

#### Customizations

Attribute | Type | Default | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
`draw-error-box` | boolean | false | When `true`, the objects that are placed inside `pl-drawing-answer` will be displayed with their respective error bounding boxes in the answer panel.

In the example above, `pl-vector` is the only object that is graded. The corresponding answer panel is given as:

<img src="pl-vector-correct-answer.png" width=50%>

### `pl-drawing-initial` element

This element will wrap all the elements included in the grading canvas that will not be graded. The objects from `pl-drawing-initial` and `pl-drawing-answer` are combined when showing the correct answer in the correct panel.

#### Customizations

Attribute | Type | Default | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
`draw-error-box` | boolean | false | When `true`, the objects that are placed inside `pl-drawing-initial` will be displayed with their respective error bounding boxes in the answer panel.

The final version of a question should not have the attribute `draw-error-box`. However this attribute can be helpful during the process of creating a question. Authors have the option of starting the grading canvas including all the objects in `pl-drawing-initial` with
`draw-error-box=true`, to see how the graded objects are placed in the canvas, and if the default tolerances are reasonable for the specific question, or if adjustments are needed. Once the question is completed, the objects that are expected to be graded can be removed from `pl-drawing-initial` and added to `pl-drawing-answer`. The author can decide if the students should see the error box when the correct answer is displayed. By default, `draw-error-box="false"`.

### `pl-controls` element

The element `pl-controls` will add the buttons that allows students to place objects in the canvas. The element `pl-controls-group` can be used to group buttons that have similar properties, for example, graded and non-graded objects.

```html
<pl-controls>
  <pl-controls-group label="Graded objects:" >
      <pl-drawing-button type="pl-vector"></pl-drawing-button>
  </pl-controls-group>
  <pl-controls-group label="Delete button:">
      <pl-drawing-button type="delete"></pl-drawing-button>
  </pl-controls-group>
</pl-controls>
```

#### Example implementations

The example [demo/drawing/gradeVector] illustrates all the `pl-drawing-button`
that are currently implemented.

<img src="pl-all-buttons.png" width=70%>

### `pl-drawing-buttons` element

#### To insert a point:

```html
<pl-drawing-button type="pl-point"></pl-drawing-button>
```

This button adds a point to the canvas. The grading algorithm will check if the submitted point is within the error box. By default, the error box for `pl-point` is a square centered at the correct point, with side of length `tol = 0.5*grid-size`. The tolerance `tol` is an attribute of `pl-drawing` to make sure that all elements use the same tolerance.

<img src="pl-point-error-box.png" width=30%>

#### To insert a vector:

```html
<pl-drawing-button type="pl-vector"></pl-drawing-button>
```
This button adds a vector to the canvas. A vector is marked as correct when the position of the anchor point (tail of the vector) is within the error bounding box and the absolute error of the angle is less than `angle-tol`.

 By default, the error box for `pl-vector` is a rectangle aligned with direction of the vector. The width of the rectangle is `tol` and the height is `hb + hf`, as illustrated below. `hb = offset-backward + tol` and `hf = offset-forward + tol`. The attribute `offset-backward` is set to the length of the vector by default. The attribute `offset-forward` is set to zero by default. The tolerances `tol` and `angle-tol` are attributes of `pl-drawing` to make sure that all elements use the same tolerance.

<img src="pl-vector-error-box-zoom.png" width=50%>

If the orientation of the vector is not important, so that vectors `p` and `-p` are both considered correct, the attribute `disregard-sense` should be set to `true`.

If a vector is expected as a correct answer, but the author does not want to assign a grade to it, the attribute `optional-grading` can be set to `true`. In this case, the grading algorithm will not assign points to the vector, but will not penalize students either by considering it as extra objects.


#### To insert an arc vector:

```html
<pl-drawing-button type="pl-arc-vector-CWW"></pl-drawing-button>
<pl-drawing-button type="pl-arc-vector-CW"></pl-drawing-button>
```
This button adds an arc vector to the canvas. The arc vector is marked as correct when the position of the anchor point (center of the arc vector) is within the error bounding box and the orientation is correct.

By default, the error box for `pl-arc-vector` is a square centered at the anchor point, with side of length `tol = 0.5*grid-size`. The tolerance `tol` is an attribute of `pl-drawing` to make sure that all elements use the same tolerance.

If the orientation of the arc vector is not important (both clockwise and counter-clockwise orientations are accepted), the attribute `disregard-sense` should be set to `true`.

#### To insert a distributed load:

```html
<pl-drawing-button type="pl-distributed-load" w1="20"  anchor_is_tail="true"></pl-drawing-button>
<pl-drawing-button type="pl-distributed-load" w1="20"  anchor_is_tail="false"></pl-drawing-button>
<pl-drawing-button type="pl-distributed-load"></pl-drawing-button>
```
This button adds a distributed load to the canvas. A distributed load is marked as correct when the position of the anchor point (center of the baseline) is within the error bounding box, the absolute error of the angle is less than `angle-tol`, the absolute error of the range (interval) is less than `tol`, and the expected distribution is matched (if uniform, `w1 = w2` and for triangular load, `w1>w2` or `w2>w1` from submitted answer match the correct answer).

The error box for `pl-distributed-load` is  defined in the same way as `pl-vector` but considering the anchor point as the center of the baseline. If the orientation of the distributed load is not important, the attribute `disregard-sense` should be set to `true`.


#### To insert a "help" line:

```html
<pl-drawing-button type="help-line"></pl-drawing-button>
```
This button will add a line to the canvas that is not graded, but can be used by students to facilitate the placement of other objects.

#### To delete any object previously placed in the canvas:

```html
<pl-drawing-button type="delete"></pl-drawing-button>
```

This button deletes objects that were previously placed on the canvas.

### `pl-axes` element

A `pl-axes` element adds two axes to define the coordinate plane for sketching plots.

#### Customizations

Attribute | Type | Default | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
`origin` | string | '{"x": 0, "y": 0}' | Position of the origin of the coordinate system w.r.t the origin of the canvas (top/left corner). "x" is the horizontal distance from the left border of the canvas. "y" is the vertical distance from the top border of the canvas.
`xneg` | float | 20 | Length of the negative part of the x-axis.
`yneg` | float | 160 | Length of the negative part of the y-axis.
`xpos` | float | 400 | Length of the positive part of the x-axis.
`ypos` | float | 160 | Length of the positive part of the y-axis.
`label-x` | string | 'x' | Text to label the x-axis.
`offsetx-label-x` | float | 0 | Horizontal offset distance of `label-x`.
`offsety-label-x` | float | 0 | Vertical offset distance of `label-x`.
`label-y` | string | 'y' | Text to label the y-axis.
`offsetx-label-y` | float | -30 | Horizontal offset distance of `label-y`.
`offsety-label-y` | float | -10 | Vertical offset distance of `label-y`.
`supporting-lines` | string | | Add additional grid lines to help with the sketching. For example, '[{"x":80},{"y":40}]' adds a vertical line passing through position `x=80` with respect to `origin`, i.e., the origin of the coordinate system defined by the plot axes. It also adds a horizontal line passing through `y=40` with respect to `origin`.
`grid-label` | string | | Add labels to specified grid points. For example, '[ {"axis": "x", "pos": 80,  "lab": "4" } ]' adds the label `4` at position `x=80` with respect to `origin`. If additional adjustment of the position of the label is needed, this attribute can have two additional optional keys: `offsetx` and `offsety`, i.e., '[ {"axis": "x", "pos": 80,  "lab": "4", "offsetx": 10, "offsety":20 } ]'
`color` | string | black | Set the color of the coordinate system ( [PL colors](https://prairielearn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/course/#colors) or [HTML colors](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/color-chart/) ).
`stroke-width` | float | 2 | Set the width of the stroke.

### `pl-graph-line` element

A `pl-graph-line` element adds straight or quadratic lines to plots. It wraps the elements `pl-controlled-line` and `pl-controlled-curved-line` so that the end and control points can be defined with respect to the origin of the plot, instead of the origin of the canvas. When only two points are given, it draws straight lines. If three points are given, it draws a quadratic curve. It also provides an option to create quadratic curves using the gradient information of the end points, instead of giving the position of the control point.

#### Customizations

Attribute | Type | Default | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
`origin` | string | '{"x": 0, "y": 0}' | Position of the origin of the coordinate system w.r.t the origin of the canvas (top/left corner). "x" is the horizontal distance from the left border of the canvas. "y" is the vertical distance from the top border of the canvas.
`end-points` | string | | Provides the coordinates of the end points of the line w.r.t `origin`, i.e., the origin of the coordinate system defined by the plot axes. For example, a straight line is defined by two end points, given by `end-points='[{"x": 80, "y": -80}, {"x": 160, "y": -80}]'`. To plot a quadratic curve, the control point coordinates can be provided as the third element of the list, i.e., `end-points='[{"x": 0, "y": 0}, {"x": 80, "y": 80}, {"x": 40, "y": 80}]'`.
`end-gradients` | string | | Provides the derivative of the line at the end points. This information is used to determine the position of the control point when plotting quadratic curves. Note that only one of the options can be used to plot quadratic curves: either provide `end-gradients` or the third point in the list `end-points`.
`draw-error-box` | boolean | - | Draw the error bounding box, where the location of the end points and control point are accepted as correct.
`offset-tol-x` | float | 0 | Half the length of the bounding box in the x-direction. The end point is at the center of the bounding box.
`offset-tol-y` | float | 0 | Half the length of the bounding box in the y-direction. The end point is at the center of the bounding box.
`offset-control-tol-x` | float | 0 | Half the length of the bounding box in the x-direction. The control point is at the center of the bounding box.
`offset-control-tol-y` | float | 0 | Half the length of the bounding box in the y-direction. The control point is at the center of the bounding box.
`color` | string | red | Set the color of the coordinate system ( [PL colors](https://prairielearn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/course/#colors) or [HTML colors](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/color-chart/) ).
`stroke-width` | float | 4 | Set the width of the stroke.
