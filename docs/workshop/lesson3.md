# Lesson 3: Looking at more specialized elements

Convert these questions from the "paper-pencil" format to PrairieLearn.

## Example 1:

Given a matrix $A$ and a vector $b$, compute the matrix-vector multiplication $y = Ab$

**Consider:**

* $A$ and $b$ are randomized
* How do you want to provide (display) the matrices? Take a look at `pl-variable-output`, `pl-matrix-latex` and `pl-python-variable`.
* How do you want students to submit their answers? Take a look at `pl-matrix-component-input` and `pl-matrix-input`.
