# PrairieLearn Workshop

In this 5-day training course, we will provide an introduction to the following topics:

 
* how to create questions and assessments
* overview of existing PL elements
* how to use the external grader
* how to use the drawing tools

We will introduce a new topic in each session, and provide an activity to be completed during the meeting time. You will also receive a small "homework" after each session.


## What you need to do BEFORE the workshop

We will need to give you access to PrairieLearn before the workshop starts. The first thing you need to do is to login at [https://prairielearn.engr.illinois.edu/pl/](https://prairielearn.engr.illinois.edu/pl/) (in case you have never done this before). 

We are processing all the access requests using the PrairieLearn Slack [`#request-course`](https://go.illinois.edu/joinplslack) channel. Check the options below, and see which one best fits your situation:

### 1) You are a Course Instructor:

Provide the following information in the [`#request-course`](https://go.illinois.edu/joinplslack) channel:


```html
Course rubric: XX-100
Course name: Super Fun Course
Your email: netid@illinois.edu
Your institution: UIUC
```


### 2) You are a Teaching Assistant already assigned to a course 

Provide the following information in the [`#request-course`](https://go.illinois.edu/joinplslack) channel:


```html
I want access to the course listed below:
Course rubric: XX-100
Instructor name: 
Your email: netid@illinois.edu
```

### 3) Others

You may be a teaching assistant not yet assigned to a course, or just someone wanting to learn how to use PrairieLearn, without any connections to a course. Everyone is welcome!

Provide the following information in the [`#request-course`](https://go.illinois.edu/joinplslack) channel:


```html
I want access to the training course TRAIN-101
Your email: netid@illinois.edu
```

Note that we will add all teaching assistants to `TRAIN-101`, in addition to their assigned courses (in case that information is available).

## HOMEWORK 0: complete BEFORE the workshop starts!

Once you receive an email indicating that you have access to PrairieLearn, complete the [Get Started](../getStarted.md) tutorial, which will show you how to create:

* course instances
* assessments
* questions

If you are using the course `TRAIN-101`, when adding your course instance, use:

```json
"longName": "Summer 2020 xxxx"
```
where `xxxx` is your netid.
