# PrairieLearn Workshop

In this 5-day training course, we will provide an introduction to the following topics:

 
* how to create questions and assessments
* overview of existing PL elements
* how to use the external grader
* how to use the drawing tools


## What you need to do BEFORE the workshop

1. **Login to PrairieLearn** at [https://prairielearn.engr.illinois.edu/pl/](https://prairielearn.engr.illinois.edu/pl/) (in case you have never done this before). This is necessary so that we can give you access to PrairieLearn before the workshop starts.

2. **Request course access.** We are processing all the access requests using the PrairieLearn Slack [`#request-course`](https://go.illinois.edu/joinplslack) channel. Check the options below for instructions.

3. **Complete Homework 0.** See below for instructions on Homework 0. It would be very helpful if you can do this before the first meeting on Monday.
