# PrairieLearn Workshop

In this 5-day training course, we will provide an introduction to the following topics:

 
* how to create questions and assessments
* overview of existing PL elements
* how to use the external grader
* how to use the drawing tools

We will introduce a new topic in each session, and provide an activity to be completed during the meeting time. You will also receive a small "homework" to do before each session, and I will be giving feedback on your homework solutions.


## What you need to do BEFORE the workshop

1. **Login to PrairieLearn** at [https://prairielearn.engr.illinois.edu/pl/](https://prairielearn.engr.illinois.edu/pl/) (in case you have never done this before). This is necessary so that we can give you access to PrairieLearn before the workshop starts.

2. **Request course access.** We are processing all the access requests using the PrairieLearn Slack [`#request-course`](https://go.illinois.edu/joinplslack) channel. Check the options below for instructions.

3. **Complete Homework 0.** See below for instructions on Homework 0. It would be very helpful if you can do this before the first meeting on Monday.

### 3) Others

You may be a teaching assistant not yet assigned to a course, or just someone wanting to learn how to use PrairieLearn, without any connections to a course. Everyone is welcome!

Note that we will add all teaching assistants to `TRAIN-101`, in addition to their assigned courses (in case that information is available).

## HOMEWORK 0: complete BEFORE the workshop starts!

Once you receive an email indicating that you have access to PrairieLearn, complete the [Get Started](../getStarted.md) tutorial, which will show you how to create:

* course instances

If you are using the course `TRAIN-101`, when adding your course instance, use:

```json

```
where `xxxx` is your netid.
