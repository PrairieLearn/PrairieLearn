# Developer Guide

This section provides documentation for working with the PrairieLearn codebase.

If you are developing your own elements, we recommend running with [local source](installingLocal.md) in Docker. Then check out the [element development guide](../devElements.md).

If you need to run the test suite, we recommend running [natively](installingNative.md).
