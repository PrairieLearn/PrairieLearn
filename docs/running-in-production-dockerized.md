# Running in Production Dockerized

As the PrairieLearn source code is publicly-available, it's possible to run PrairieLearn on your own infrastructure. Running a single instance of the PrairieLearn server may be appropriate for tens or hundreds of total users, and a number of universities have done this successfully.

## Getting started

Follow the steps to [install PrairieLearn with local source code](./installingLocal.md). Then run this command in the root folder:
```sh 
docker-compose -f docker-compose-production.yml up
```
Then access PrairieLearn from port `3000`.

## Configuration

PrairieLearn can be configured by a `config.json` in the root of the repository.

- First make the file `config.json` in your root repository.
- Add the following line to `docker-compose-production.yml` under `volumes`:

```sh
- ./config.json:/PrairieLearn/config.json
```

The `config.json` file should contain appropriate overrides for the keys in [`lib/config.js`](`https://github.com/PrairieLearn/PrairieLearn/blob/master/lib/config.js`). At a minimum, you'll probably want to update the various `postgres*` options to point it at your database.

## Reverse Proxy

A reverse proxy can be implemented using something like [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/howto/reverse_proxy.html) or [NGINX](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/web-server/reverse-proxy/).

In `config.json` to configure your domain add:

```json
{
"serverCanonicalHost": "https://yourdomain"
}
```

## Authentication

PrairieLearn currently has 4 ways to do user authentication. Read more at [authentication](./authentication.md).

## Admin User

After setting up authentication we can elevate a user that's logged into the system to administrator status:

- Find the name of your running PrairieLearn container by running

```sh
docker ps
```

which will output multiple columns of information about your running container(s). Look for the `prairielearn/prairielearn` image and copy its corresponding name. For example, the name of the PrairieLearn container in this `docker ps` output is `upbeat_roentgen`:

```
CONTAINER ID  IMAGE                      COMMAND              CREATED      STATUS      PORTS                   NAMES
e0f522f41ea4  prairielearn/prairielearn  "/bin/sh -c /Praiâ€¦"  2 hours ago  Up 2 hours  0.0.0.0:3000->3000/tcp  upbeat_roentgen
```

- Open a shell in your PrairieLearn container by running

```sh
docker exec -it CONTAINER_NAME /bin/bash
```

- Connect to the postgres database by running

```sh
psql postgres
```

- Check the users table by running

```sh
SELECT * FROM users;
```

Which will display a table of users in the database:
```sh
 user_id |       uid        |    uin    |   name   | lti_course_instance_id | lti_user_id | lti_context_id | institution_id | deleted_at 
---------+------------------+-----------+----------+------------------------+-------------+----------------+----------------+------------
       1 | dev@illinois.edu | 000000000 | Dev User |                        |             |                |              1 |
```

Add the desired user to the administrators table by running

```sh
INSERT INTO administrators (user_id) VALUES (user_id from users table);
```
