# Assessments

**NOTE:** Any time you edit or add an `infoAssessment.json` file on a local copy of PrairieLearn, you need to click the “Load from disk” button in the header so that the local PrairieLearn server reloads the changes.

## Overview

Each assessment is a single directory in the `assessments` folder or any subfolder.  Assessments may be nested in subdirectories of the `assessments` folder.  The assessment directory must contain a single file called `infoAssessment.json` that describes the assessment and looks like:

```json
{
    "uuid": "cef0cbf3-6458-4f13-a418-ee4d7e7505dd",
    "type": "Exam",
    "title": "Coordinates and Vectors",
    "set": "Quiz",
    "number": "2",
    "allowAccess": [],
    "zones": []
}
```

The assessment ID is the full path relative to `assessments`.

* [Format specification for assessment `infoAssessment.json`](https://github.com/PrairieLearn/PrairieLearn/blob/master/schemas/schemas/infoAssessment.json)

## Assessment naming

Assessments are organized into `sets` (e.g., `Homework`, `Quiz`, `Exam`) and within each set the assessment has a `number`. Additionally, each assessment has a `title`. Depending on the context, assessments are referred to by either a _short name_ or a _long name_. The format of these is:

* Short name = `Set Number` (e.g., `Quiz 2` in the above example).

* Long name = `Set Number: Title` (e.g., `Quiz 2: Coordinates and Vectors` above).

You can select a set from the list of [standardized assessment sets](course.md#standardized-assessment-sets) or create your [own](course.md#adding-your-own-assessment-sets). 

## Assessment types

Each assessment has a `type`, as listed below. A randomized assessment is one where each student gets a different set of questions in a randomized order, while a non-randomized assessment shows all students the same list of questions in the same order. Broadly speaking, randomized assessments are designed for exams and non-randomized assessments are designed for homeworks.

Type        | Randomized | Description
---         | ---        | ---
`Homework`  | No         | A gamified assessment that rewards repeated correct answers to questions.
`Exam`      | Yes        | An exam where students can grade their answers at any time, and retry questions for reduced points.

## Changing question-order randomization

To make `Homework` assessments randomize the question order for each student, set the `"shuffleQuestions": true` option in the `infoAssessment.json` file. This will use a unique-per-course number for each question, so that all students will still get the same question numbers (like #427), but they will not be in order. This makes it easy for students to discuss questions with course staff; they can say “I don't know how to do #427” and everyone will be seeing the same question #427. The main advantage of randomizing question order on Homeworks is to enable data collection on question difficulty and student behavior that is independent of the order in which questions are listed on the assessment.

There is currently no way to disable question order randomization for `Exam` assessments. However, the order of `zones` is fixed (see below), which can be used to control question order.

## Question specification

An assessment is broken down in to a list of zones, like this:

```json
"zones": [
    {
        "title": "Easy questions",
        "questions": [
            {"id": "anEasyQ", "points": [10, 5, 3, 1, 0.5, 0.25]},
            {"id": "aSlightlyHarderQ", "points": [10, 9, 7, 5]}
        ]
    },
    {
        "title": "Hard questions",
        "questions": [
            {"id": "hardQV1", "points": 10},
            {"id": "reallyHardQ", "points": [10, 10, 10]},
            {
                "numberChoose": 1,
                "points": 5,
                "alternatives": [
                    {"id": "FirstAltQ", "points": 10},
                    {"id": "SecondAltQ"}
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
],
```

* Each zone appears in the given order in the assessment. Zone titles are optional and are displayed to the student if present.

* Within each zone the question order is randomized for `Exam` assessments.

* An assessment question can be specified by either a single `id` or by a list of alternatives, in which case one or more of these alternatives is chosen at random. Once the question `id` is determined, then a random variant of that question is selected. Question alternatives inherit the points of their parent group, if specified.

* If a zone has `maxPoints`, then, of the points that are awarded for answering questions in this zone, at most `maxPoints` will count toward the total points.

* If a zone has `bestQuestions`, then, of the questions in this zone, only `bestQuestions` with the highest number of awarded points will count toward the total points.

## Assessment and question instances and resetting assessments

PrairieLearn distinguishes between *assessments* and *assessment instances*. A *assessment* is determined by the code in an `assessments` directory, and is something like "Midterm 1". Given an assessment, PrairieLearn needs to generate the random set of questions and question variants for each student, and it is this selection that is the *assessment instance* for the student. There is only one copy of each assessment, but every student has their own assessment instance. The rules for updating assessment instances differ between `Homework` and `Exam` assessments.

**`Exam` assessment updates:** Exam assessment instances are generated when the student starts the exam, and they are never automatically deleted, regenerated, or updated, even when the original assessment is changed in some way. This is a safety mechanism to avoid having students' assessments changed during an exam. However, if you want to force the regeneration of assessment instances then you can do so with the “reset” button on instructor view of the assessment. While writing an assessment you might need to do this many times. Once an assessment is live, you should of course be very careful about doing this (basically, don’t do it on a production server once an assessment is underway).

**`Homework` assessment updates:** New questions added to Homeworks will be automatically integrated into student homeworks currently in progress. Updates to `maxPoints` will take effect the next time a student grades a question. A student's “points” and “percentage score” will never decrease.

## Multiple-instance versus single-instance assessments

By default all assessments are *single instance*, meaning that each student has exactly one instance of the assessment that they can complete, and once they have completed that assessment instance then they cannot do the assessment again. This is the expected behavior for homeworks, quizzes, exams, etc.

For practice exams it is often desirable to make a *multiple instance* assessment by setting the option `"multipleInstance": true`. This will allow students to create new assessment instances and try the whole assessment repeatedly.

## Enabling group work for collaborative assessments

By default, assessment instances are tied to only one user. By setting `groupWork: true`, multiple students will be able to work on the same assessment instance.

### Instructor options for groupWork

![Instructor group assignment page](groupwork_instructor_interface.png)

Underneath the "Groups" tab in an assessment, instructors have three ways of assigning students to different groups:

1. Uploading a CSV file in the following format:
```
groupName,UID
teamA,one@example.com
teamA,two@example.com
teamB,three@example.com
teamB,four@example.com
```

2. Automatically assigning students, either to fill out existing groups or to make entirely new ones.

3. Copying the group assignments from another assessment.

A copy of the current group assignments can be saved from the "Downloads" tab, under `<assessment>_group_configs.csv`

### Student options for groupWork

![Student perspective for joining a group](groupwork_student_perspective_join.png)

If an instructor does not assign a student to a group, the student will need to join one before opening their assessment instance. They can either create a new one or join an existing group via a join code, which they can get from another classmate.

When calculating a student's grade for a group assessment, PrairieLearn will always use the score of their group's assessment instance.

> Note: Students cannot see eachother's edits in real-time, although this is planned for a future version of PrairieLearn.

![Student view of assessment with groupwork enabled](groupwork_student_perspective_assessment.png)

Students are able to see their groupmates' UIDs, which can become a point of contact to communicate with eachother outside of PrairieLearn. They are also able to leave their group to join a different one.

## Auto-closing Exam assessments

By default Exam assessments will auto-close after six hours of inactivity by the student. This generally means that you don't need to explicity close exams that students accidentally did not close when they were done. If you want to prevent auto-closing then you can set `"autoClose": false` as a top-level option in the `infoAssessment.json` file.

## Issue reporting

To allow students to report issues with questions (incorrect answers, unclear wording, etc), set the `"allowIssueReporting": true` property in the `infoAssessment.json` file, or set it to `false` to disallow reporting. This option defaults to `true`.

When issue reporting is allowed, students see a button labeled "Report an error in this question" and they can submit a short text form.

![Report an issue button](assessment-report1.png) ![Describe the issue](assessment-report2.png)

Course staff see any reported issues show up on the "Issues" tab.

![Issue report](assessment-report4.png)

## Access control

See the [Access control page](accessControl.md) for details.

By default, an assessment is only accessible to `Instructor` users. To change this, the `allowAccess` option can be used in the assessment's `infoAssessment.json` file.

## Adding text and links to assessments

See the [`clientFiles` and `serverFiles`](clientServerFiles.md) page for details, and [`exam1` in the example course](https://github.com/PrairieLearn/PrairieLearn/blob/master/exampleCourse/courseInstances/Sp15/assessments/exam1/) for an example.

## Student-attached files

Students can attach files to assessments, either by uploading them or by pasting the file contents as text. This can be done on the assessment overview page, or on individual question pages. These files can be viewed by the student anytime they can view the assessment.

The purpose of this is to allow students to take extra notes during exams, for later review. For example, if a student has a Matlab script that they used to solve a question, they could attach it to that question so they can review it later.

This file attachment functionality does not provide a way for students to attach files before an exam starts, so it can't be used for student-provided "formula sheets" on exams.

## Disabling real-time grading

PrairieLearn is designed to give students immediate feedback on their work. However, if you wish to more closely replicate a paper exam experience, you can prevent students from grading their work as they go (what we call "real-time grading").

*Note that students generally expect and benefit from having immediate feedback, so this setting should only be enabled if you have a specific reason for it.*

To disable real-time grading for an assessment, add `"allowRealTimeGrading": false` to the assessment's `infoAssessment.json` file. This will hide the "Save & Grade" button on student question pages; only the "Save" button will be available. The "Grade saved answers" button on the assessment overview will also be hidden. Note that real-time grading can only be disabled for `Exam` assessments, as immediate feedback is a core part of the `Homework` experience.

An assessment without real-time grading will not show any score information during the exam. However, if a [time limit](accessControl.md#time-limits) is used then when it runs out the assessment will auto-grade and show students exactly which questions they got correct/incorrect. The same revealing behavior will happen if an instructor manually closes and grades the student assessment. To prevent this, set the [`showClosedAssessment` access rule restriction](accessControl.md#showinghiding-closed-assessments).

Disabling real-time grading changes a lot of fundamental details of how PrairieLearn is used. To account for that, the student assessment overview page displays less information about points and grading than for usual exams.

Here is the assessment page for a normal exam with real-time grading enabled:

![Normal assessment](assessment-grading-normal.png)

Here is the assessment page for an open exam with real-time grading disabled:

![Open assessment with real-time grading disabled](assessment-grading-disabled-open.png)

Compared to the normal assessment, there are a number of differences:

* A warning explaining that real-time grading has been disabled is shown
* Total points is listed as a number, not as an "X/Y" score
* The percentage bar is not displayed
* The "Best submission" column is renamed to "Submission status"
* The "Available points" column has been removed
* The "Awarded points" column has been renamed to "Points" and only shows the max points

Here is the assessment page for a closed exam with real-time grading disabled:

![Closed assessment with real-time grading disabled](assessment-grading-disabled-closed.png)

Note that after the exam has closed and been graded, more information about points will be visible.

## Honor code

By default, `Exam` assessments require students to certify their identity and pledge an honor code before starting the assessment:

* I certify that I am `name` and I am allowed to take this assessment.
* I pledge on my honor that I will not give or receive any unauthorized assistance on this assessment and that all work will be my own.

To disable this requirement, set `"requireHonorCode": false` as a top-level option in the `infoAssessment.json` file.

The text of the honor code was based on the University of Maryland's [Honor Pledge](https://www.studentconduct.umd.edu/honor-pledge) and the University of Rochester's [Honor Pledge for Exams](https://www.rochester.edu/college/honesty/instructors/pledge.html). This is a "modified" honor code ([McCabe et al., 2002](https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1014893102151)), as opposed to "traditional" codes that typically also require students to report any violations of the honor code they observe.
