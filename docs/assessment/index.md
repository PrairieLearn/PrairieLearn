# Assessments

Assessments are a collection of questions that are administered to students. They can be used to create homeworks, and exams. Creating an assessment is done in two seperate parts:

1. [Configuring the questions, scoring, and other assessment-specific settings](configuration.md)
2. [Configuring access control for the assessment (due dates, credit, etc.)](accessControl.md)
