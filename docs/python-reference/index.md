# Python Reference

These are autogenerated Python references for the PrairieLearn library. These helpers are available in the Python environment when running a PrairieLearn question.

!!! note

    The `prairielearn` module is not fully documented yet. Please refer to the [source code](https://github.com/PrairieLearn/PrairieLearn/tree/master/apps/prairielearn/python/prairielearn) for a full reference.

You can use

```python
from prairielearn import ...
```

to use any of these helpers. Any code from `prairielearn.internal` should be considered internal and may change without notice.

!!! warning

    Do not use imports like

    ```python
    from prairielearn.<submodule> import X
    ```

    Except for

    ```python
    from prairielearn import X
    from prairielearn.colors import Y
    from prairielearn.to_precision import Z
    ```

    which are all safe to use. This is because the internal structure of the `prairielearn` module may change without notice excluding the `colors` and `to_precision` submodules.

!!! warning

    The following imports are now deprecated.

    === "Old"

        ```python
        import colors
        import to_precision
        import python_helper_sympy
        ```

    === "New"

        ```python
        import prairielearn.colors
        import prairielearn.to_precision
        import prairielearn.sympy_utils
        ```
