# Developer Guide

This section provides documentation for all aspects of using PrairieLearn as a developer.

If you are developing your own elements, we reccommend running with [local source](../installingLocal.md) in docker. Then check out the [element development guide](../devElements.md).

If you need to run the test suite, we reccommend running [natively](../installingNative.md).
