# Installing with local source code

This page describes the procedure to run PrairieLearn within Docker, but using a locally-installed version of the PrairieLearn source code. This is the recommended way to do PrairieLearn development. This is tested and supported on MacOS, Linux, and Windows.

* First install the Docker version of PrairieLearn as described in the [installation documentation](installing.md).

* Clone PrairieLearn from the main repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/PrairieLearn/PrairieLearn.git
```

* Install the Node.js packages.  This will use the version of `npm` that is pre-installed in the Docker image, so you don't need your own copy installed.

```sh
docker run -w /PrairieLearn -v /path/to/PrairieLearn:/PrairieLearn prairielearn/prairielearn /usr/local/bin/npm ci
```

The path `/path/to/PrairieLearn` should be replaced with the *absolute* path to the PrairieLearn source on your computer.  If you're in the root of the source directory already, you can substitute `%cd%` (on Windows) or `$PWD` (Linux and MacOS) for `/path/to/PrairieLearn`.

By default, PrairieLearn will load `exampleCourse`, `testCourse`, and any courses mounted at `/course` and `/course[2-9]` in the Docker container.  To override this behavior, you can create a custom [`config.json` file](configJson.md).

* Run it with:

```sh
docker run -it --rm -p 3000:3000 -v /path/to/PrairieLearn:/PrairieLearn prairielearn/prairielearn
```

By default, PrairieLearn does not monitor for server-side changes, so it will **not** automatically restart the node server when you change the node source. To enable automatic live-reloading of server-side changes, use the `-e` flag to set the `NODEMON=true` environment variable:

```sh
docker run -it --rm -p 3000:3000 -e NODEMON=true -v /path/to/PrairieLearn:/PrairieLearn prairielearn/prairielearn
```

### Running a specific branch

By default, the above command will run PrairieLearn from the `master` branch on GitHub.  If you would like to run a different branch (to test it, for example), the branch name can be appended to the end of the image name as such:

```sh
docker run -it --rm -p 3000:3000 -v /path/to/PrairieLearn:/PrairieLearn prairielearn/prairielearn:BRANCH_NAME
```

Note that any forward slashes (`/`) in the branch name will be need to be converted to underscores (`_`).

### Running commands in Docker

If needed, you can run the container with a different command:

```sh
docker run -it --rm -p 3000:3000 -v /path/to/PrairieLearn:/PrairieLearn prairielearn/prairielearn COMMAND
```

This can be used to, e.g., run scripts distributed with PrairieLearn by opening a bash shell:

```sh
docker run -it --rm -p 3000:3000 -v /path/to/PrairieLearn:/PrairieLearn prairielearn/prairielearn /bin/bash
```

#### Server from shell

When making local changes to server-side code, it is faster to restart only the node server instead of the whole docker container. This can be done either

* automatically by using the `-e NODEMON=true` setting as described earlier,

* or manually by starting the server from a shell instance:

```sh
/PrairieLearn/docker/init.sh
```

and when any modifications are made, you can close the server with `<ctrl-C>` and re-run the init script.

#### Tests from shell

The linters and tests for the Python and JavaScript code can be run with the following commands in a shell instance:

```sh
cd /PrairieLearn
./docker/start_postgres.sh
./docker/lint_js.sh
./docker/lint_python.sh
./docker/test_js.sh
./docker/test_python.sh
```

### Connecting to an existing Docker container

The previous shells were launched in their own containers. If you want to open a shell in a Docker container that is *already running*, you can find the container's name and connect to it.

* Find the name of your running PrairieLearn container by running

```sh
docker ps
```

which will output multiple columns of information about your running container(s). Look for the `prairielearn/prairielearn` image and copy its corresponding name. For example, the name of the PrairieLearn container in this `docker ps` output is `upbeat_roentgen`:

```
CONTAINER ID  IMAGE                      COMMAND              CREATED      STATUS      PORTS                   NAMES
e0f522f41ea4  prairielearn/prairielearn  "/bin/sh -c /Praiâ€¦"  2 hours ago  Up 2 hours  0.0.0.0:3000->3000/tcp  upbeat_roentgen
```


* Open a shell in your PrairieLearn container by running

```sh
docker exec -it CONTAINER_NAME /bin/bash
```

### Using tmux in a container

While developing, you might need or want to run multiple programs simultaneously (e.g., querying in `psql` without killing the `node` server). Rather than repeatedly canceling and restarting programs back and forth, you can use a terminal multiplexer like `tmux` to keep them running simultaneously.

The PrairieLearn Docker images are built with `tmux` installed. If you start a container with a shell then you can first run `tmux` before running other commands.

Tmux creates virtual windows which run simultaneously (you only see one window at a time). Tmux is controlled by typing a `Ctrl-b` and then another key. The basic commands are:

* `Ctrl-b` `c` - create a new window
* `Ctrl-b` `0` - switch to window number 0 (also `Ctrl-b` `1` switches to window 1, etc.)
* `Ctrl-b` `d` - detaches from tmux back to the original shell, which you can exit to terminate the container

Google `tmux` for tutorials that demonstrate many more capabilities.
