# Create content in the browser

Now that you have access to your course in [https://prairielearn.org](https://prairielearn.org), it is time to start creating course content.

This is a view of your course home page (or a similar variation, depending on when your course was originally created):

![](start-guide/homepage.png)

This tutorial will show you how to create:

- [a course instance](#creating-a-course-instance)

- [simple questions from scratch](#creating-questions-from-scratch)

- [questions starting from provided examples](#creating-questions-from-the-example-course)

- [assessments](#creating-a-new-assessment)

### Creating a course instance

A course instance corresponds to a single offering of a course, such as "Fall 2020", or possibly "Fall 2020, Section M". Follow the steps below to create a new course instance:

- click the button `Add course instance`.

- click the button `Change CIID` to change the course instance ID name. Typically we recommend using a short version of the course instance name, for example, `Fa20`.

- click the `Edit` button next to `infoCourseInstance.json`.

- in `longName`, add your course instance name. For example:

```json
"longName": "Fall 2020, Section M"
```

- in `allowAccess`, you should set the dates in which you want your course to be available (other [access options](courseInstance.md#course-instance-allowaccess)). For example:

```json
"allowAccess": [
    {
        "startDate": "2020-08-17T00:00:01",
        "endDate": "2020-12-18T23:59:59"
    }
]
```

- click `Save and sync`.

- You will be able to see the new course instance from the course home page.

### Creating questions from scratch

##### Add a new question

- go to the `Questions` tab. Your questions page should be similar to the example below:

![](start-guide/question_tab.png)

- click the button `Add question`.

- click the button `Change QID` to change the question ID name. Typically, question authors choose QID that provide some big-picture idea of the question topic. For example, `find_rectangle_area`.

- click the `Edit` button next to `info.json`.

- change the question `title`. For example:

```json
"title": "Find the area"
```

- change the question `topic`. This will be very helpful when using the filter to find questions under a specific topic. For example:

```json
"topic": "Geometric properties"
```

- change the question `tags`. Use [tags](course.md/#tags) to add more levels to your filter. We recommend adding the netid of the question author and the semester when the question was created. For our example, we use:

```json
"tags": [
    "mfsilva",
    "fa20",
    "MC",
    "calculate"
],
```

- you should not change the `"type": "v3"` field, which is the most current version of PrairieLearn questions.

- click `Save and sync`.

**Change the content of the question**

To provide a simple example, here we first create a question without any randomization, by modifying the file [question.html](question.md#question-questionhtml).

- go to the `Files` tab.

- click the `Edit` button next to `question.html`.

- Modify the content of the file. You may want to start by copying this simple example:

```html
<pl-question-panel>
  <p>What is the area of a rectangle that has sides 4 and 5?</p>
</pl-question-panel>

<pl-multiple-choice answers-name="area">
  <pl-answer correct="true">20</pl-answer>
  <pl-answer correct="false">10</pl-answer>
  <pl-answer correct="false">9</pl-answer>
  <pl-answer correct="false">18</pl-answer>
  <pl-answer correct="false">40</pl-answer>
</pl-multiple-choice>
```

- click `Save and sync`

- go to the `Preview` tab to see your question. Try it out!

- if you go back to the question tab, you should see your new question.

![](start-guide/question_add_new_1.png)

Note that this question does not use any server side code, and for that reason, the file `server.py` is not needed. Indeed, you could just delete `server.py` for this question. (we will not remove the file for the purpose of the following steps of this tutorial).

##### Start a new question from an existing one

- from the `Questions` tab, select the question you want to copy. As an example, we will use the question with QID `find_rectangle_area`.

- go to the `Settings` tab.

- click the button `Make a copy of this question`. Click `Submit` to make a copy of the question inside your own course.

- click the button `Change QID` to change the question ID name. In this example, we will use `find_rectangle_area_rand`.

- click the `Edit` button next to `info.json`.

- change the question `title`. In this case, you can just remove `(copy 1)` from the title, come up with another one, or leave it as is.

- you can change `topic` and `tags` as needed.

- click `Save and sync`.

**Change the content of the question**

We will add randomization to the previous question, using the file [server.py](question.md#question-serverpy)

- go to the `Files` tab.

- click the `Edit` button next to `server.py`. Here is where you can define the question variables, and add randomization. We will talk about some other examples in later sections. Here is a how we can modify the original area example:

```python
import random
def generate(data):
  # define the sides of the rectangle as random integers
  a = random.randint(2,5)
  b = random.randint(11,19)
  # store the sides in the dictionary "params"
  data["params"]["a"] = a
  data["params"]["b"] = b
  # define some typical distractors
  data["params"]["distractor1"] = (a*b)/2
  data["params"]["distractor2"] = 2*(a*b)
  data["params"]["distractor3"] = 2*(a+b)
  data["params"]["distractor4"] = (a+b)
  # define the correct answer
  data["params"]["truearea"] = a*b
```

- click `Save and sync`.

- go to the `Files` tab.

- click the `Edit` button next to `question.html`.

```html
<pl-question-panel>
  <p>What is the area of a rectangle that has sides {{params.a}} and {{params.b}}?</p>
</pl-question-panel>

<pl-multiple-choice answers-name="area">
  <pl-answer correct="true">{{params.truearea}}</pl-answer>
  <pl-answer correct="false">{{params.distractor1}}</pl-answer>
  <pl-answer correct="false">{{params.distractor2}}</pl-answer>
  <pl-answer correct="false">{{params.distractor3}}</pl-answer>
  <pl-answer correct="false">{{params.distractor4}}</pl-answer>
</pl-multiple-choice>
```

- click `Save and sync`.

- go to the `Preview` tab to see your question. Try it out! Check a different variant and see how the variables change.

### Creating questions from the example course

You should also have access to the example course `XC 101`. From the top menu, next to the PrairieLearn homepage button, you can select other courses that you were allowed access to (depicted in red in the figure below). Select `XC 101`. If you cannot see the example course, contact us on Slack (`#pl-help`) and we will make sure you gain access.

![](start-guide/change-example-course.png)

You will find a variety of questions in the example course. This is probably your best starting point when creating questions for the first time. Let's see how you can copy one of the example questions to your own course:

- from the `Questions` tab, click on the question `Template pl-integer-input: randomized input parameters` (QID: `template/integerInput`).

- click on the `Settings` tab.

- click the button `Make a copy of this question`. Select your course and click `Submit`.

- That is it! Go to the `Questions` tab and you will see the question was added to your course. You can modify the question following the steps from the section above.

### Creating a new assessment

Before you create an assessment, make sure you are in the desired course instance. For example, we want to create a homework assessment in the "Fall 2020" course instance, as indicated below.

![](start-guide/create_assessment.png)

- click the button `Add assessment`.

- click the button `Change AID` to change the assessment ID name. In general, we use names such as `Homework1` or `Exam5`.

- click the `Edit` button next to `infoAssessment.json`.

- select the [assessment type](assessment.md#assessment-types) to be either `Homework` or `Exam`. For this example, we will use `Homework`.

- change the `title`. For example:

```json
"title": "Geometric properties and applications",
```

- you can change the assessment `set`, which is used for better organization of the course instance. PrairieLearn has some standardized sets (eg. Homework, Quiz, Exam), and you can also [create your own](course.md#assessment-sets).

- change the number of the assessment (within its set). This number will be used to sort the assessments in the `Assessment` page.

- in `allowAccess` you should set the dates in which you want the assessment to be available. Read the documentation about [Access controls](https://prairielearn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/accessControl/) to learn about the different configurations available. In this example, we will use:

```json
"allowAccess": [
    {
        "startDate": "2020-09-01T20:00:00",
        "endDate": "2020-09-06T20:00:00",
        "credit": 100
    }
]
```

- in `zones` you should enter the questions to be included in that assessment. We will add the two questions that we just created:

```json
"zones": [
    {
        "questions": [
            {"id": "find_rectangle_area_rand", "points": 1, "maxPoints": 5},
            {"id": "integerInput", "points": 1, "maxPoints": 5}
        ]
    }
]
```

- click `Save and sync`.
