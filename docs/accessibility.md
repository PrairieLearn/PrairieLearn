# Accessibility

PrairieLearn is designed to be used by all students, including those that use screen readers or other assistive technologies. Wherever possible, PrairieLearn follows widely-accepted best practices for web accessibility that users may already be familiar with from other websites.

## Math content

Instructors can use MathJax to display content like mathematical equations, formulas, and other LaTeX content. MathJax has built in support for navigation with screen readers and the keyboard. For more information, please consult the [MathJax accessibility documentation](https://mathjax.github.io/MathJax-a11y/docs/#reader-guide).

## Other content

While PrairieLearn strives to be accessible to all users, there's always room for improvement, and either your instructor or the PrairieLearn team can work with you to address any issues:

- If you encounter any accessibility issues with course content like individual questions, you should contact your instructor, who may have to update the content or provide an alternative access method.
- If you encounter any accessibility issues with the PrairieLearn platform itself, you can contact the PrairieLearn team at [hello@prairielearn.com](mailto:hello@prairielearn.com) or file an issue on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/PrairieLearn/PrairieLearn/issues).
