# Request your course space

To request your PrairieLearn course space, you can use the "Request course" links on the PrairieLearn home page or in the main dropdown menu.

This will bring you to a web form where you can request your course.

This would also be a good opportunity to join the PrairieLearn Slack, if you haven't already: [:fontawesome-brands-slack: https://prairielearn.com/slack](https://prairielearn.com/slack). The Slack is a great place to ask questions and get help from the PrairieLearn community.
