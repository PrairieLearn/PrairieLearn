## Admin User Setup

After setting up authentication we can elevate a user that's logged into the system to administrator status:

- Connect to the postgres database by running

```sh
psql postgres
```

- Check the users table by running

```sql
SELECT * FROM users;
```

Which will display a table of users in the database:

```sql
 user_id |       uid        |    uin    |   name   | lti_course_instance_id | lti_user_id | lti_context_id | institution_id | deleted_at
---------+------------------+-----------+----------+------------------------+-------------+----------------+----------------+------------
       1 | dev@illinois.edu | 000000000 | Dev User |                        |             |                |              1 |
```

Add the desired user to the administrators table by running

```sql
INSERT INTO administrators (user_id) VALUES (user_id from users table);
```
