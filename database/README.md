# Database schema

This directory contains a human-readable version of the database schema. The migration files are stored in the [`migrations`](../apps/prairielearn/src/migrations/) directory. More information about the database schema can be found on the docs in the [developer guide](https://prairielearn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev-guide/).
