    Particle $1$ with mass $m_1 = {{params.m1}}$ mg and charge $q_1 = {{params.q1}} \mu \rm C$ is placed at the bottom of an incline plane. Another particle $2$ with mass $m_2 = {{params.m2}}$ mg and charge $q_2 = {{params.q2}} \mu \rm C$ is placed at the incline plane at a distance $d$ away from the first particle. The incline plane has an angle of ${{params.theta}}$ with the ground.

<p>
    What should be the distance $d$ such that particle $1$ remains in equilibrium?
