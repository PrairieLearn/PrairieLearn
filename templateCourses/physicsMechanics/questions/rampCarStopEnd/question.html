    In some mountain highways, ramps of lose gravel are constructed to stop runaway trucks that have lost their brakes. A large coefficient of friction, combined with an upward slope and sufficient distance, will allow the truck to reduce its speed until a safe stop. When designing the ramp, you assume the truck will reach the start of a ramp with incline $\theta = {{params.theta}}^o$ at a speed of {{params.v0}} km/h. Assume the acceleration due to gravity is $g=9.8 \rm\ m/s^2$.
