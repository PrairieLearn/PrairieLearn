When improperly designed, a concrete dam idealized as a concrete block on top 
of a flat surface may overturn from the inner water pressure built up. Hence, a safy factor (SF), 
the stabilizing moment due to the weight of the dam divided 
by the overturning moment by the water pressure force about the tipping point of the dam, $A$,
is used when designing the dam to prevent such event from happening.

If the dam has a cross-section that has the shape of a quarter circle with radius 
$r$ = {{params.r}} m, density $\rho_{concrete}=$ 2.5 Mg/m$^3$, and {{params.given}}, find {{params.question}}.
Use $\rho_{water}=$ 1 Mg/m$^3$ for the density of water, and assume the width of the dam is the same as the 
width of the water reservoir.
