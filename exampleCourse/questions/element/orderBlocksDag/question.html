This question illustrates the <code>grading-method="dag"</code> mode of
<a href="https://prairielearn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/elements/pl-order-blocks"><code>pl-order-blocks</code></a>,
which is especially useful for constructing mathematical proofs.

Prove that $A \land B \land C \rightarrow A \land C$
</p>

<p>
This example uses the attribute <code>grading-method="dag"</code> to control how the correct solution is ordered.
This is especially useful when you want students to construct a mathematical proof, where the dependency of lines of the
proof on one another is given by a directed acyclic graph (DAG) structure. The <code>depends</code> attribute on each
line is used to denote which lines of the proof must appear before a particular line.
Then a correct answer is a topological sort of the lines of the proof.
The attribute <code>solution-placement="bottom"</code> is used
to display the input area above the output area.
