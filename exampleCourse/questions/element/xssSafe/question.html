  <p>The typical use of this element would be to provide, in the submission panel, a formatted view of a student's HTML or Markdown code. In that case, a <code>pl-file-editor</code> or <code>pl-file-upload</code> element provides the interface for the user to input the code in the question panel, while the same file name is used in the <code>pl-xss-safe</code> element to identify the file.</p>

  <p>The element <code>pl-xss-safe</code> also supports content that does not come from a file, using the <code>contents</code> attribute. A typical use-case for this processing is when a regular element is used that does not save its content in a file, such as a <code>pl-string-input</code>. In that case, <code>contents="{{submitted_answers.answers_name}}"</code> provides the content to be displayed.</p>
  <p>Provide the input <code>This is a **bold** text</code> to make the word bold.</p>
