This question demonstrates the ability of `<pl-image-capture>` to let students submit captured images from their webcam or external device, such as a phone or tablet. The question also demonstrates what `<pl-image-capture>` looks like when mobile capture is disabled.

The first part of the question requests the derivative f'(x) of a function f(x), along with work shown step-by-step and submitted through `pl-image-capture`. The second part of the question requests a sketch of the region bounded by two curves.
