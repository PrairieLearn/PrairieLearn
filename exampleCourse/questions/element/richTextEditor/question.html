    If there is more than one <code>pl-rich-text-editor</code> element on the
    page, additional instances of the element must be given a unique
    <code>file-name</code> attribute. This attribute is the name of the file
    where the student answer will be saved to. Also, the rich text editor can be
    pre-populated with a starter template by adding text into the element, or by
    using
    <code>source-file-name="initial.html"</code>.

  <code>counter="word"</code> respectively. The default setting, <code>counter="none"</code>,
  disables the counter.</p>

  <p>This element also supports the ability to disable clipboard operations
  like cut, copy and paste, by setting <code>clipboard-enabled="false"</code>.
  In such cases, attempts to use clipboard operations will be ignored. Note
  that the editor content is still available in the browser's developer tools,
  which would allow students to copy the content anyway. Also note that
  preventing operations like copying or pasting text may be detrimental to the
  student's experience, and as such should be avoided unless absolutely
  necessary.</p>

    <a href="https://quilljs.com/docs/themes/">Other themes may
      also be used</a> by
    setting <code>quill-theme="bubble"</code>. The <code>bubble</code>
    theme, for example, hides the toolbar, but opens a tooltip
    when the user selects some text, with common formatting
    options.

    The element also supports setting the initial content using Markdown
    format by setting <code>format="markdown"</code>. This option allows the
    source file name or content to be interpreted in this format. The student
    experience will not typically be significantly affected. The output format
    of the file is still set to HTML, as a conversion to Markdown may cause
    loss of data or formatting.
