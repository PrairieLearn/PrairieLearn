    <p>A character or word counter can be turned on by setting <code>counter="character"</code> or
    <code>counter="word"</code> respectively. The default setting, <code>counter="none"</code>,
    disables the counter.</p>

    <p>This element also supports the ability to disable clipboard operations
    like cut, copy and paste, by setting <code>clipboard-enabled="false"</code>.
    In such cases, attempts to use clipboard operations will be ignored. Note
    that the editor content is still available in the browser's developer tools,
    which would allow students to copy the content anyway. Also note that
    preventing operations like copying or pasting text may be detrimental to the
    student's experience, and as such should be avoided unless absolutely
    necessary.</p>

      <a href="https://quilljs.com/docs/themes/">Other themes may
        also be used</a> by
      setting <code>quill-theme="bubble"</code>. The <code>bubble</code>
      theme, for example, hides the toolbar, but opens a tooltip
      when the user selects some text, with common formatting
      options.

      The element also supports markdown format by
      setting <code>format="markdown"</code>. This option will cause
      the final result to be saved in markdown, and also allows the
      source file name or content to be interpreted in this
      format. The student experience will not typically be
      significantly affected.
    </p>

    <div class="alert alert-info">The use of format="markdown" is not recommended except for very narrow circumstances. Due to the nature of markdown syntax, some combinations of content, such as blank paragraphs or formatting inside code, may be lost or corrupted in the conversion to markdown. If possible, use the default format, which is HTML.</div>
