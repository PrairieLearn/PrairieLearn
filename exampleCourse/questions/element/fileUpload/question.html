<pl-question-panel>

  <p> You can use the element <code>pl-file-upload</code> when you want to manually grade answers from students,
    or if you just want to have records of their solution process. By default, only file names listed in 
    <code>file-names</code> can be uploaded and all files in the list must be provided.</p>

  <pl-file-upload file-names="solution.txt"></pl-file-upload>

  <p> Instead of (or in addition to) mandatory file names, it is possible to provide an <code>optional-file-names</code> 
    list that marks files as optional. By default, even if all files are listed as optional, at least one file 
    must be uploaded for the submission to be valid.
  </p>

  <pl-file-upload optional-file-names="solution.txt,solution.doc,solution.pdf"></pl-file-upload>

  <p> By setting <code>allow-blank="true"</code> and only listing optional files, submissions without any files
    can be allowed as well. In addition, <code>optional-file-names</code> supports a number of 
    <a href="http://prairielearn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/elements/#pl-file-upload-element">wildcard patterns</a>
    to allow ranges of file names.</p>
  <p> Note that using wildcard patterns will allow multiple files to be uploaded per pattern, as long as each 
    file name matches a pattern.</p>

  <pl-file-upload allow-blank="true" optional-file-names="solution.???,solution[0-9].pdf,*.py"></pl-file-upload>
