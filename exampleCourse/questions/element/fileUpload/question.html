<pl-question-panel>

  <p> You can use the element <code>pl-file-upload</code> when you want to manually grade answers from students,
    or if you just want to have records of their solution process. By default, only file names listed in 
    <code>file-names</code> can be uploaded and all files in the list must be provided.</p>

  <pl-file-upload file-names="solution.txt"></pl-file-upload>

  <p> Instead of (or in addition to) mandatory file names, it is possible to provide an <code>optional-file-names</code> 
    list that marks files as optional. By default, even if all files are listed as optional, at least one file 
    must be uploaded for the submission to be valid.
  </p>

  <pl-file-upload optional-file-names="solution.txt,solution.doc,solution.pdf"></pl-file-upload>

  <p> By setting <code>allow-blank="true"</code> and only listing optional files, submissions without any files
    can be allowed as well. In addition, <code>optional-file-names</code> supports a number of wildcard patterns 
    to allow ranges of file names:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The <code>?</code> placeholder allows a single wildcard character. For example, <code>solution?.txt</code> allows 
        files like "solution1.txt", "solution2.txt", and so on, but not "solution10.txt".</li>
      <li>The <code>*</code> placeholder allows an arbitrary number of wildcard characters. For example, <code>*.txt</code> 
        allows files like "solution.txt", "my_file.txt", and also ".txt".</li>
      <li>The <code>[seq]</code> placeholder allows a single character from the set of options listed inside the square
        brackets. For example, <code>file_[abc].txt</code> allows "file_a.txt", "file_b.txt" and "file_c.txt", but not 
        "file_x.txt".</li>
      <li>The <code>[seq]</code> placeholder also supports ranges like "a-z" or "0-9". For example, <code>file_[0-9].txt
        </code> allows "file_5.txt", but not "file_x.txt", while <code>file_[a-z].txt</code> allows the "file_x.txt" and 
        not "file_5.txt". Ranges can also be combined. For example, <code>file_[0-9a-z]</code> allows any alphanumeric 
        character.</li>
    </ul>
  <p> All wildcard patterns are case insensitive (e.g.,  <code>[a-z]</code> also allows uppercase letters). Note that using 
    wildcard patterns will allow multiple files to be uploaded per pattern, as long as each file name matches a pattern.</p>
