  <p> You can use the element <code>pl-file-upload</code> when you want to manually grade answers from students,
    or if you just want to have records of their solution process. By default, only file names listed in 
    <code>file-names</code> can be uploaded and all files in the list must be provided.</p>

  <pl-file-upload file-names="solution.txt"></pl-file-upload>

  <p> Instead of (or in addition to) mandatory file names, it is possible to provide an <code>optional-file-names</code> 
    list that marks files as optional. Note that if no mandatory file names are specified, empty submissions are considered valid.
  </p>

  <pl-file-upload file-names="solution.py" optional-file-names="explanation.txt"></pl-file-upload>

  <p> <code>optional-file-names</code> supports a number of 
    <a href="http://prairielearn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/elements/#pl-file-upload-element">wildcard patterns</a>
    to allow ranges of file names.</p>
  <p> Note that using wildcard patterns will allow multiple files to be uploaded per pattern, as long as each 
    file name matches at least one pattern.</p>
  <p> Also note that we use multiple <code>pl-file-upload</code> elements here for illustrative purposes, but that
  <a href="http://prairielearn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/elements/#pl-file-upload-element">it is not recommended</a> to
    use more than one for real questions.</p>
