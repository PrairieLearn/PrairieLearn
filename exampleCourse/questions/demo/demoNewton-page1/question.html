    Newton's laws of motion are three physical laws that, together, laid the foundation for classical mechanics.
    They describe the relationship between a body and the forces acting upon it, and its motion in response to those forces.
    More precisely, the first law defines the force qualitatively, the second law offers a quantitative measure of the force,
    and the third asserts that a single isolated force doesn't exist.

    In an inertial frame of reference, an object either remains at rest or continues to move at a constant velocity,
    unless acted upon by a force.

    In an inertial frame of reference, an object remains at rest unless acted upon by a force.

  <pl-answer correct=true>
    In an inertial frame of reference, the vector sum of the forces $F$ on an object is equal to the mass $m$ of
    that object multiplied by the acceleration $a$ of the object (assuming a constant mass).

  <pl-answer correct=true>
    When one body exerts a force on a second body, the second body simultaneously exerts a force equal in
    magnitude and opposite in direction on the first body.
  </pl-answer>
  <pl-answer correct=false>
    When one body exerts a force on a second body,
    the second body will move with positive acceleration away from the first body.
