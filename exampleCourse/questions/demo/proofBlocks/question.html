  <p> You can use Proof Blocks by using a <code>pl-order-blocks</code> element
    with <code>grading-method="dag"</code>. Use the <code>depends</code>
    attribute on each line is to denote which lines of the proof must appear
    before that line. The autograder will use this dependency information to
    construct the dependency graph of the proof. Then a correct answer is a
    topological sort of the lines of the proof. This example also uses the option
    <code>feedback="first-wrong"</code> to give the student feedback about where
    the first wrong line of their proof was.

    <strong>Example 1:</strong> Use a proof by contrapositive to show that if $2m^2 + n + 1$ is even then either $m$ or $n$ are odd.

    <strong>Example 2:</strong>Let $A, B,$ and $C$ be propositions. Prove that $(A \land C) \lor (A \land B) \rightarrow A $
  </p>

  <p>
    This example uses the <code>pl-block-group</code> element, which can be used
    to divide a proof into cases. In a proof that has cases, a correct answer is
    any topological sort of the lines, with the added condition that any lines in
    the same <code>pl-block-group</code> element must appear contiguously in the
    solution, as when you are writing a proof by cases, you finish one case before
    proving the next case.
