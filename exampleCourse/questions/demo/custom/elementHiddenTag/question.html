<pl-question-panel>
    <p> This question has an example of an element that uses hidden input tags to send information to the server. Hidden inputs are useful for custom JavaScript elements that have custom data to be graded. Keep in mind that users can manipulate tags using browser devtools, so make sure that all grading is handled server-side when designing questions with hidden inputs. For example, do not grade the question client-side and return the number of earned points in a hidden input. </p>
