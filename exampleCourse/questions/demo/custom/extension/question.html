    This question is a demo of the element extension capabilities in PrairieLearn.  This page has one element on it: <code class="user-output">extendable-element</code>, which loads each extension that it has and renders it to a separate card.  You can see the different functionalities of extensions below.

    Note that when using the <code class="user-output">load_all_extensions()</code> function, extensions are loaded in alphabetical order by name.
