      <p>The cells that will be graded are marked with the tag <code>#grade</code>. Do not delete
        that line and/or cell, or the autograder will not be able to find your solution.
        Once you complete each one of the <code>#grade</code> cells, you can click
        "Save & Grade" to see if you got the correct solution. </p>

  <p>To get points for this question, you will need to define the following variables inside the notebook:</p>
  <pl-external-grader-variables params-name="names_from_user">
    <pl-variable name="power_iteration" type="function">function that performs power iteration</pl-variable>
  </pl-external-grader-variables>
  <pl-external-grader-variables params-name="names_for_user" empty="true"></pl-external-grader-variables>
