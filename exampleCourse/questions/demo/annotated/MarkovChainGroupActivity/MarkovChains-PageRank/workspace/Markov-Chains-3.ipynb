By assigning each page a relative rank, web searches can give more relevant results. The idea here is to model a user surfing different web pages by randomly clicking on links.  Pages with more incoming links (they are cited more often) are presumed to be higher quality and therefore get a higher PageRank value. We can model this as a graph, where each webpage has a chance of moving to another one:\n",
