<p>The instantaneous rate of change of the function $f(t)$ is given by its derivative.</p>

<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">

<h4>Derivative of a function at a point</h4>

<p>
The derivative of $f(x)$ with respect to $x$ is the function $f'(x)$ defined as:

$$f'(x) = \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}$$

provided the limit exists.
</p>

</div>


<p> Recall that </p>

  $$\frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}$$

<p> represents the slope of the secant line that connects points $(x,f(x))$ and $(x+h,f(x+h))$.
  Therefore, when we are computing the derivatives, we are taking the limit of a collection of slope lines when the
  interval $h$ is getting smaller. <strong> So what is the graphical representation of the derivative? </strong>
