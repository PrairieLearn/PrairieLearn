        As a food researcher at large beverage company, you have been tasked with coming up with a secret formula for the next probiotic superfood: {{params.beverage}}!
         At any point in time during the fermentation process, the {{params.beverage}} solution can have <strong>four ingredients</strong> that react with
         each other: sugar water, acid, carbon dioxide, and the {{params.beverage}} culture itself.
    </p>

    <pl-figure file-name="drink.png" width="450"></pl-figure>
    <br>

    <p> You know how each ingredient of the solution changes in one hour: </p>
    <ul>
        <li> {{params.sw_to_acid}}% of the sugar water gets converted to acid, and another {{params.sw_to_culture}}% is converted to the culture. </li>
        <li> {{params.acid_to_co2}}% of the acid is converted to carbon dioxide, and {{params.acid_to_culture}}% is converted to the culture. </li>
        <li> {{params.co2_to_acid}}% of the carbon dioxide gets re-absorbed back into acid. </li>
        <li> The culture does not change into another state. </li>
    </ul>

    <p> Given the initial solution contains <strong>{{params.initial_sw}}% of sugar water and {{params.initial_culture}}% of culture</strong>,
      find how many hours it will take for the concentration of sugar water to decrease to <strong>{{params.percent_composition}}%</strong>,
      and save this as <code class="user-output">hours</code>.
      Save the composition of ingredients at this time as the 1d numpy array <code class="user-output">composition</code>, assuming the
      following ingredient's order:
    </p>

    <p>
    <pl-python-variable params-name="ingredients" prefix="composition_ingredient_order = "></pl-python-variable>
    </p>

    <p> Your code snippet should define the following variables: </p>
