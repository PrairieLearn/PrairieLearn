        This example question shows how we can use the Coverage (COV) grading scheme in a
        multiple-choice question where only one option is correct, but multiple options can be
        selected. In this question, COV grading gives a nonzero amount of credit to any valid
        submission that includes the correct option. Notice also that at most 3 options can be
        selected; we accomplish this by setting <code>max-select="3"</code> in the <code>pl-checkbox</code>
        attributes.
