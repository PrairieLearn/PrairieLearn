Assume that a linked list data structure has been defined in `list.h` as follows:

```c
struct node {
  int value;
  struct node *next;
};

struct list {
  struct node *head;
};
```

Assume that for a list `l`, the element `l->head` points to the first
element of the list.

Implement the following function that deletes the first element of the
list. All other elements of the list should remain in the list in
their original order. The function must return the value of the
element that was deleted. The element deleted from the list must be
properly de-allocated. If the list is originally empty, the function
should return -1, and should not change the list (i.e., it must remain
empty).

**Caution**: be extra careful not to use values after they have been freed.

Note: you **don't** need to write the main function.
