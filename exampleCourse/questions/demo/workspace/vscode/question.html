  <p>This is a workspace question with an in-browser VS Code (<a href="https://github.com/cdr/code-server">code-server</a>). Use the "Open workspace" button below to open VS Code.</p>

  <p><strong>Note to course developers:</strong> The code-server image is pinned to version 3.4.1 because 3.5.0 is currently affected by an intermittent "could not reconnect" bug.</p>

  <p>
    The Fibonacci numbers are 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ..., where each
    number is the sum of the two before it. These are numbered $F_1, F_2, \ldots$, and
    \[
    F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}.
    \]
  </p>

  <p>
    In the file <tt>fibonacci.py</tt> in the VS Code workspace, write a Python function <tt>fib</tt> that takes a number <tt>n</tt>
    and returns the n<sup>th</sup> Fibonacci number, $F_n$.
  </p>

  <p>Your code snippet should define the following variables:</p>
