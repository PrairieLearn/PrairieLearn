### Compound R Object

Please create a single R object named `x` containing the following:
- an integer `ii` with value 42
- a numeric `nn` with value 3.1415
- a text variable `cc` with text `hello, world!` including the comma and exclamation mark

The object above must be created in the `student.ipynb` file inside the workspace, with the solution inside of the cell that starts with `#grade` so that it is read by the autograder.

Press the button below to launch a JupyterLab (R) workspace.
