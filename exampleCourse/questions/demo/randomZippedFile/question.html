    This is a question to demonstrate random generation capabilities in PrairieLearn. Specifically,
    this question randomly generates some files from templates, then puts them into a zip file. This
    zip file is then made available for download to the student.
  </p>
  <p>
    Specifically, we generate a zip file <code>generated_files.zip</code>, containing two files,
    <code>{{params.text_file_name}}</code>, whose contents are
    <code>{{params.words_for_text}}</code>, and <code>{{params.python_file_name}}</code>, which
    contains a function named <code>{{params.function_name}}</code> that prints
    <code>Hello world!</code>.
