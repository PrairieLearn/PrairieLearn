    Convert {{params.a}} from decimal representation (base 10) to binary representation (base 2).</p>

<p>Your answer will be interpreted as a string. Do not include any leading zeros
(for example, if the answer is 11010, the binary number 0011010 will be <i>marked</i> as incorrect, however they both
represent the same integer number).
