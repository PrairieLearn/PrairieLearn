    This is a simple example question that provides a variable to the student and expects one in return.  A list of variables for the user is defined in the HTML parameter <code>names_for_user</code>, and the student can only access these from the setup code.  Similarly, a list of variables from the user can be defined in <code>names_from_user</code>.  These two parameters control access to variables in the setup and the user code, and are also used to populate the variable tables below.

  <p>
    Find the square of <code>x</code>, $x^2$, and save it as <code>x_sq</code>.
  </p>
  
  <p>The setup code gives the following variables:</p>
  <p><pl-variable-description variables-category="names_for_user"></pl-variable-description></p>
  
  <p>Your code snippet should define the following variables:</p>
  <pl-variable-description variables-category="names_from_user"></pl-variable-description>

    file-name="user_code.py"
