    Convert {{params.a}} from decimal representation (base 10) to binary representation (base 2).
  </p>

  <p>
    Your answer will be interpreted as a string. Do not include any leading zeros.
    For example, if the answer is 11010, the binary number 0011010 will be <i>marked</i>
    as incorrect, even though they both represent the same integer number.
