This question describes a safety ramp that allows trucks to stop when they lose their brakes going down a mountain highway. The question provides multiple randomly-generated parameters such as angle and speed, and the prompt is selected at random between two options: compute the length of the ramp given a friction coefficient, or compute the friction coefficient given the length of the ramp. The student must submit a numerical answer, which is checked for correctness using sigfig comparison method, where the number of digits depends on the problem prompt.
