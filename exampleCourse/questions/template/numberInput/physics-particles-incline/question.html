    Particle $1$ with mass $m_1 = {{params.m1}}$ mg and charge $q_1 = {{params.q1}} \mu \rm C$ is placed at the bottom of an incline plane. 
    Another particle $2$ with mass $m_2 = {{params.m2}}$ mg and charge $q_2 = {{params.q2}} \mu \rm C$ is placed at the incline plane at a distance $d$ away from the first particle. The incline plane has an angle of ${{params.theta}}^o$ with the ground.

    Assume  acceleration of gravity equal to $9.8$ m/s$^2$ and Coulomb constant $9 \times 10^9 \rm N \cdot m^2/C^2$.

<p>
    What should be the distance $d$ such that particle $1$ remains in equilibrium?
