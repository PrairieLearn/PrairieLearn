This question provides two matrices as both Python and MATLAB variables using the `<pl-variable-output>` element. The entries of the matrices are randomly generated. Students are asked to compute the product of these two matrices, and provide their answer using either Python or MATLAB format. The generated matrices are converted to JSON format with `pl.to_json(...)` for storage in `data["params"]` and `data["correct_answers"]`.
