## Demo Course (XC 100)

This [demo course](https://www.prairielearn.org/pl/course_instance/128605) was created to highlight the PrairieLearn features which allow instructors to create flexible, authentic and robust online assessments, including formative, summative, individual and group work.



<!--### Pre-Lecture Activities

You can use PrairieLearn assessments to provide a collection of lecture notes, slides, videos, JupyterLabs, and other course resources, combined with short quiz questions to help students check their learning progress. 

Check the demo pre-lecture assessment [L1: Presenting course content with short quiz questions](). More details regarding this assessment [here](../assessments/03-LectureContent/__docs/docs.md).-->



### Homeworks

With PrairieLearn you can deliver your homework in different formats, from traditional style with one attempt per question, to a mastery skill approach with retry attempts. Here we provide a homework example where students need to correctly answer different variants of the same question to achieve 100% score. 

Check the demo homework assessment [HW1: Homework with unlimited attempts](https://www.prairielearn.org/pl/course_instance/128605/assessment/2310476) and corresponding documentation [here](../assessments/04-Homework/__docs/docs.md).

### Group Activities

Research shows that collaborative learning can increase student persistence, improve learning outcomes, and foster better classroom cultures. Using PrairieLearn, instructors can provide group activities where students work collaborativelly in the same assessment, which is shared among all the group members. PrairieLearn provides the option for instructors to pre-arrange teams, or for students to create their own teams.
