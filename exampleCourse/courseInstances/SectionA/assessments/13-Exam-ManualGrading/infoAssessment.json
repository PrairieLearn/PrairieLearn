Instructors will later download the submission files, assign grades, and upload back the scores and feedback. </p><p> The assessment will be closed when the time limit expires (here set to 3 minutes), or once students click the 'Finish assessment' button. Students will not be able to see their total score after the assessment is closed. An additional access rule can be used to allow students to see their total score once all the questions are graded.</p>"
