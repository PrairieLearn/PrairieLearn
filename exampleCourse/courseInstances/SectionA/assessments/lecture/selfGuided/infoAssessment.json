    "text": "<p><strong>Comments about this assessment:</strong> </p><p> Just like there are different teaching methods, people also learn in different ways.

In this assessment, we combine a mixture of text, equations, plots, videos, interactive JupyterLabs, and short quiz questions to introduce new course content to students.
