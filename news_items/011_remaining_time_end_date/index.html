  <a href="https://github.com/tdy">Tim Yang</a> has fixed the timer countdown for students who start exams late. Previously, even if a student started an exam so late that they would run into the <tt>endDate</tt>, PrairieLearn would still show the full <tt>timeLimitMin</tt> countdown timer for them, but would then cut them off at <tt>endDate</tt>. With Tim's fix, the countdown timer correctly only shows the time remaining until <tt>endDate</tt>.

  <figcaption class="card-footer">The exam's countdown timer now correctly reflects that Student 2 has only 60 minutes for this 90-minute exam because they started the exam too late.</figcaption>

<p>
  When using synchronous exams (all students take the exam at the same time), it is recommended that <tt>endDate</tt> is set to give the students a 5 minute buffer. For example, a 1-hour exam starting at 2pm should have <tt>timeLimitMin</tt> set to <tt>60</tt>, a <tt>startDate</tt> of 2pm, and an <tt>endDate</tt> of 3:05pm to let students start a minute or two late and still get the full time. See the <a href="https://prairielearn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/remoteExams/">remote exams</a> and <a href="https://prairielearn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/accessControl/#time-limits">time limits</a> documentation for more information.
