  Timed exams expire based on both a relative cutoff, <code>timeLimitMin</code>, and absolute cutoff, <code>endDate</code>.
  Depending on when a student begins the exam, these two settings can interact to shorten the exam's default timer.
</p>

<p>
  If a student begins the exam close enough to <code>endDate</code> such that the remaining time to <code>endDate</code> is less than <code>timeLimitMin</code>:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    The student's exam timer will be initialized with the abbreviated time to <code>endDate</code>, not the full <code>timeLimitMin</code> (Figure 1).
  </li>
  <li>
    The student's exam timer will then be reduced by up to 60 seconds to properly sync with the server. In practice, this means the student may lose up to 60 additional seconds by beginning the exam too close to <code>endDate</code>.
  </li>
</ol>
