<p>
  When a course has multiple <i>course instances</i> (semesters),
  PrairieLearn will now order them in reverse date order. This
  improvement is thanks to <a href="https://github.com/tbretl">Tim
  Bretl</a> and means that you should now see a sensible ordering
  like:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Spring 2020</li>
  <li>Fall 2019</li>
  <li>Spring 2019</li>
  <li>Fall 2018</li>
</ul>

<p>
  The most recent course instance should be first in the list and
  older ones are below.
</p>

<p>
  <b>How exactly are they ordered?</b> The date used for ordering is
  the first-access date for each course instance. You can see this
  date by clicking on the course rubric (e.g., "TAM 212") in the top
  navigation bar and then selecting the "Course instances" tab. This
  date is determined from the <tt>infoCourseInstance.json</tt> files,
  where PrairieLearn uses the earliest <tt>startDate</tt> of
  any <tt>allowAccess</tt> rule. In case of ties between dates,
  the <tt>endDate</tt> is used as a tie breaker.
</p>

<p>
  <b>How did PrairieLearn used to order the course instances?</b>
  Before this change, PrairieLearn used a combination of an
  undocumented <tt>number</tt> field in
  the <tt>infoCourseInstance.json</tt> files and an internal database
  identifier. This often resulted in an apparently random order. The
  new order should be better in all cases, but do let us know if you
  encounter a bad ordering.
