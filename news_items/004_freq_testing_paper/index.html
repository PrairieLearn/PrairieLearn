  In this recently published paper, <a href="https://engineering.purdue.edu/ENE/People/ptProfile?resource_id=222158">Jason Morphew</a> and co-authors showed that frequent short PrairieLearn exams in the CBTF (Computer-Based Testing Facility) substantially increased student learning in TAM 251 ("Introductory Solid Mechanics") at the University of Illinois. Most impressively, these learning gains were on an identical pen-and-paper final exam and there were improvements at all grade levels.

<p>
  <b>How did TAM 251 use the CBTF?</b> In previous semesters the course used a <i>traditional exam schedule</i> with two pen-and-paper midterm exams. <a href="https://mfsilva.web.illinois.edu">Mariana Silva</a> converted it to a <i>frequent exam schedule</i> with seven short CBTF exams and seven optional second-chance retry exams (see Figure 1). The new exams were all implemented in PrairieLearn and allowed students to re-attempt questions for partial credit, with a mastery grading scheme that only awarded points for correct answers.

  <b>How much did student learning improve?</b> An identical pen-and-paper final exam was given in both semesters. Students using the frequent exam schedule scored 7% higher on average (about 2/3 of a letter grade), despite the fact that they had not practiced a pen-and-paper exam before in this class. This resulted in twice the number of A grades on the final exam and a drop of 60% in D and F grades (see Figure 2). There were over 200 students in each of the traditional- and frequent-exam semesters so all the results are statistically significant. As shown in the paper, women and minority students had the same increases as the rest of the population.

  <b>What's the theory behind these results?</b> Overall, it seems likely that students both study harder and use more effective study strategies when given frequent tests, for at least three reasons. First, having many small exams essentially forces students to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_practice">distributed practice</a> rather than cramming. Second, testing is simply more effective at solidifying memory than just studying (the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testing_effect">testing effect</a> in psychology). Third, second-chance exams and mastery grading encourage students to learn from their errors on the first-chance exams, rather than simply dismissing the results as a fluke or the result of an unfair test, thereby improving <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacognition">metacognition</a>.
