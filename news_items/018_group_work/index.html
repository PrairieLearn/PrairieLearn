  Thanks to a huge development effort led
  by <a href="https://github.com/frankyhao">Frankie Yuan</a>
  and <a href="https://github.com/zhining4">Zhining Qiu</a>
  PrairieLearn now supports group assessments. This lets students
  collaboratively work on an assessment together, with everyone in the
  group submitting answers to the same questions and everyone
  receiving the same shared scores.

  There is a flexible group assignment system that allows instructors
  to either assign students to groups (via CSV upload or randomly
  generated by PrairieLearn) or let students make their own groups.

  This new group assessment feature is ideal for discussion sections
  or labs where students are expected to work together on a sequence
  of problems. Groups are also good for in-class collaborative
  activities.
