  <a href="https://github.com/nicknytko">Nicolas Nytko</a> (CS BS '19, CS MS '21)
  has added some big improvements to PrairieLearn.
</p>

<h5 class="mt-4">Fraction input</h5>

<p>
  One of the most-requested features ever! You can now enter fractions
  in most places where numbers are input:
</p>

<p>
  You can even enter fractions with decimal points, like <tt>10.4/12.6</tt>
</p>



<h5 class="mt-4">Clear handling of invalid answers</h5>

<p>
  If you submit an answer that PrairieLearn can't understand,
  like <code>asf#$%J34jkl</code> when a number is expected, you
  will now be clearly shown that something is wrong:
</p>

<p>
  Best of all, PrairieLearn doesn't count invalid answers as
  "attempts", so you don't lose any points!
</p>

<p>
  Clicking on the <span class="badge
  badge-secondary">Why <i class="fas fa-question-circle"></i></span>
  button will give more information on why the answer couldn't be
  understood, including some example answers that are valid and
  invalid:

<h5 class="mt-4">Other improvements for answer inputs</h5>

<p>
  Previously, questions could fail if the instructor changed the
  question code after you started working. Now PrairieLearn will show
  a "Missing Input" label instead of an error to ensure the question is able to be displayed:
</p>

<p>
  Input with strange Unicode characters is now displayed so that all
  characters are visible (using the <tt>&lt;U+xxxx&gt;</tt> syntax for
  unprintable characters) and any leading or trailing spaces are
  clear:
</p>

<p>
  Inputs with "tall" labels will now correctly scale:
