  Practice is important in learning and there should be room for
  mistakes and learning from them. Immediate feedback can help as it
  can give feedback despite the limited human resources. However, to
  prevent mindless trial-and-error problem solving, controlling
  resubmissions can be an effective tool

  Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/jonatanschroeder">Jonatan Schroeder</a>, PrairieLearn now allows instructors to limit the amount of feedback provided to students by setting the rate at which graded submissions are allowed, in effect blocking students from requesting grade too often. The <code>gradeRateMinutes</code> setting was added, which indicates how long a student needs to wait after grading a question to resubmit a new answer to the same question for grading.
</p>
  
<pre class="mb-2 rounded">
"zones": [
    {
        "gradeRateMinutes": 30,
        "questions": [
            {"id": "canOnlySubmitEvery30minutes", "points": 10},
            {"id": "canOnlySubmitEvery60minutes", "points": 10, "gradeRateMinutes": 60},
            {"id": "canSubmitAnytime", "points": 10, "gradeRateMinutes": 0}
        ]
    }
],
</pre>

<p>
   Students are still able to save a submission, but are not able to grade until either the waiting time has elapsed, or when they finish the assesment.
