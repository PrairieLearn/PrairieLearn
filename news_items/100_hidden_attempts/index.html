<p>
  Students with <a href="https://github.com/PrairieLearn/PrairieLearn/issues/2086">awkwardly large lists of practice assessments</a> will be pleased to know that multiple attempts on assessments are now displayed on the assessment page instead of the course page. From the assessment page, you can choose to view old attempts, or start a new one.
