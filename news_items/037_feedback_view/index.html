  Thanks to the work of numerous contributors, the PrairieLearn
  development team is looking forward to introducing improvements in
  the instructor's experience for manual grading questions in the
  coming months. As part of these improvements, some changes in visual
  elements for the student's question view become necessary. So if you
  have any questions that use manual grading, you may need to review
  some of your questions.
</p>
<p>
  One of the features of manual grading is the ability to provide
  open-ended feedback to students, which allows students to understand
  their misconceptions and improve their learning experience. This
  feedback is typically provided
  using <a href="https://prairielearn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/manualGrading/#uploading-the-scores-and-feedback"
  target="_blank">the grade upload feature</a>, and so far required
  question creators to include it explicitly in
  the <code>question.html</code> file. However, a recent change has
  updated the student's question page to show this feedback by default
  instead.
</p>
<p>
  <img src="manualGradingFeedback.png" class="border rounded w-75" alt="The feedback content is shown in a card just above the submission panel.">
</p>
<p>
  One caveat of the change above is that, if
  the <code>question.html</code> file continues to include the
  feedback in the submission panel, then feedback will be shown to
  students twice, once in the new panel, and once where it was shown
  before. To avoid this duplication, instructors are strongly
  encouraged to remove any reference to the manual feedback text from
  their questions.
</p>
<p>
  For most instructors using manual feedback, the question will
  include a reference to <code>{{{feedback.manual}}}</code> somewhere
  in the question file. For reference, the manual grading
  documentation had the following snippet as a suggestion. You are
  encouraged to remove this snippet from your questions.
</p>
<pre class="border rounded bg-light p-2">
&lt;pl-submission-panel&gt;
  {{#feedback.manual}}
  &lt;p&gt;Feedback from course staff:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;markdown&gt;{{{feedback.manual}}}&lt;/markdown&gt;
  {{/feedback.manual}}
&lt;/pl-submission-panel&gt;
