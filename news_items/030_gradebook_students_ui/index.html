<p>
  After extensive
  feedback, <a href="https://github.com/jonatanschroeder">Jonatan
  Schroeder</a>, with input
  from <a href="https://github.com/jbrightuniverse">James Yu</a>
  (University of British Columbia), has improved the user interface
  for two major pages in the PrairieLearn instructor interface: the
  instructor Gradebook page, and the Students page for an assessment.
</p>

<p>
  New features include:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Headers remain visible even when scrolling down, simplifying the
    identification of which values refer to each column;</li>
  <li>A built-in search function allows instructors to filter specific students;</li>
  <li>Instructors can select which columns are visible or hidden, allowing for easier analysis and comparison of grades between assessments;</li>
  <li>Some updates like grade changes and time limit updates are performed without reloading the page, maintaining sort, search, scrolling and column selection intact;</li>
  <li>The assessment students page can be refreshed while the assessment is active without reloading the page, including an option to auto-refresh every 30 seconds;</li>
  <li>The assessment students page also includes pagination, which allows instructors of large classes to load the page faster.</li>
</ul>
