<p>
  For classes with many students, the Gradebook and Students pages have
  been dramatically improved
  by <a href="https://github.com/jonatanschroeder">Jonatan
  Schroeder</a>, with input
  from <a href="https://github.com/jbrightuniverse">James Yu</a>
  (University of British Columbia).
</p>

<p>
  When you scroll these pages, the header row and student ID column
  are now pinned and always visible. This makes the Gradebook so much
  better with huge classes and many assessments! There are also many
  other new features that help with large classes, including built-in
  search, toggleable column visibility, and auto-refresh so that you
  can see scores changing as students are working on assessments.
</p>

<p>
  Try out the new pages by switching to "Instructor view" in any
  course and going to either:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>"Gradebook" in the top menubar</li>
  <li>"Assessments" → <i>choose assessment</i> → "Students" tab</li>
</ul>
