  Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/tdy">Tim Yang</a>,
  PrairieLearn exams now default to starting with an identity
  certification and honor code pledge:
</p>

<img src="honor_code.png" width="700px">

<p>
  The "Start assessment" button is disabled until the student clicks
  the checkbox to "certify and pledge the above."
</p>

<p>
  You can remove the honor code by setting <tt>"requireHonorCode":
  false</tt> as a top-level option in the <tt>infoAssessment.json</tt>
  file. See
  <a href="https://prairielearn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/assessment/#honor-code">the
  documentation</a> for details.
</p>

<p>
  The text of the honor code was based on the University of Maryland's
  <a href="https://www.studentconduct.umd.edu/honor-pledge">Honor
  Pledge</a> and the University of
  Rochester's <a href="https://www.rochester.edu/college/honesty/instructors/pledge.html">Honor
  Pledge for Exams</a>. This is a "modified" honor
  code (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1014893102151">McCabe et
  al., 2002</a>), as opposed to "traditional" codes that typically also
  require students to report any violations of the honor code they
  observe.
