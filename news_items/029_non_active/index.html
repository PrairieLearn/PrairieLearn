<p>
  Thanks to great work by 
  <a href="https://github.com/echau01">Eugene Chau</a>, a student in
  the University of British Columbia, it is now possible to allow
  students to see, in the course homepage, a list of future
  assessments, before they are made active. This list allows students
  to plan ahead for future assessments, as it includes the release
  date, but students are unable to see the assessment questions or to
  submit any work.

<p>
  The same feature can also be used to allow students to see their
  completed assessments for review after the deadline has
  passed. Students can review the questions, their answers and their
  scores, but are unable to submit any further answers. Students that
  had not yet started the assessment by this time are unable to view
  the assessment questions at all.
</p>

<p>
  You can set up your assessments to be visible, but not active, by
  creating a new access rule with the <code>active</code> setting set
  to <code>false</code>. For students that have not yet started the
  assessment, this will allow them to see it listed on the course
  homepage, but will prevent them from starting a new instance of the
  assessment. For students that have already started the assessment,
  this will allow them to see the assessment questions and previously
  submitted answers, but not to submit new ones.
