  <a href="https://github.com/nwalters512">Nathan Walters</a> has
  re-implemented the course "sync" logic inside PrairieLearn. The sync
  code translates the course configuration files from the on-disk git
  repository into the live database, and the old sync code used to
  stop at the first error in a JSON file. In contrast, the new sync
  code will keep going and sync all the rest of the course.

<p>
  This change is especially useful if multiple people are editing
  course content at the same time in the online web editor. Now, if one
  person introduces an error in a question or assessment, everyone
  else can continue editing different questions and assessments
  without interruption. Before, everyone used to have to wait until the
  error was fixed.

  The sync code is one of the core components of PrairieLearn so
  rewriting it was a significant challenge. Syncing a course
  configuration that contains errors is especially difficult because
  there are many dependencies between objects in PrairieLearn. For
  example, if a question file contains errors, what should happen to
  assessments which use that question? Nathan developed an elegant new
  syncing algorithm that has the correct behavior in all such
  situations&mdash;a very impressive achievement! The new sync code
  also comes with a test suite that verifies its behavior in many edge
  cases.
