<p>
  Thanks to great work by 
  <a href="https://github.com/echau01">Eugene Chau</a>, a student in
  the University of British Columbia, it is now possible to allow
  students to see assessments that are not available for submission,
  either before their release date, or after their deadline.
</p>

<p>
  This feature allows students to visualize and plan for future
  assessments, potentially from the start of the term. It also allows
  instructors to release completed assessments for review while
  blocking any further submission.
</p>

<p>
  You can set up your assessments to be visible, but not submittable
  by creating a new access rule with the <code>submittable</code>
  setting set to <code>false</code>. This will allow students that
  have not started the assessment to see it while prevent them from
  starting a new instance of the assessment. It will also allow
  students that completing the assessment to see their answers, but
  not to submit new ones.
