<p>
    You can now declare a list of units for your course inside
    of your course configuration. These are collections of
    assessments that can belong to different sets, which get 
    displayed together in the order that you declare them. You 
    can think of them as units of instruction for your course. 
    If you want to group together several types of assessments 
    (for example, two homeworks and an exam), now you can!
