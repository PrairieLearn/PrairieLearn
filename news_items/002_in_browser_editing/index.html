  Thanks to a huge amount of work
  by <a href="https://github.com/tbretl">Tim Bretl</a>, PrairieLearn
  now allows you to edit all course content directly within your web
  browser. This includes JSON files, HTML pages, Python scripts, and
  many other file types. Just click on the <b>"Files"</b> tabs and
  look for <b>"Edit"</b> buttons.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Edit on the main PrairieLearn website.</b> You can edit files
  directly on the live website. This will automatically commit them to
  GitHub, so you stay in sync, and will also make the changes live
  immediately. This is especially convenient when you want to make a
  small change to a question or assessment. Only users who are course
  "Owners" or "Editors" can edit files. These permissions can be set
  by clicking on the Course Name (e.g., "XC 101") in the top
  navigation bar and then the "Access" tab.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Edit on your local computer.</b> PrairieLearn will always
  continue to support editing course content on your local computer
  and syncing via git. As well as using a local file editor, you can
  now also edit files locally in your web browser. Unlike editing on
  the production website, local editing will not automatically sync to
  GitHub or make changes live.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Copy via the "Settings" tab.</b> The easiest way to make a new
  question, assessment, or whole course instance is to copy an
  existing one. To do this, go to the "Settings" tab for the object
  you want to copy and look for the "Copy" button near the
  bottom. Copying will automatically generate a new UUID for you and
  put you on the "Settings" tab for the new object so you can edit its
  name. You can even copy questions between courses!
</p>

<p>
  <b>Easy question renaming.</b> Previously, changing the QID of a
  question (the directory name) meant that you had to update all
  assessments that referenced it. Now, if you use the "Change QID"
  button on the "Settings" tab of a question, then all assessments
  using that question will be automatically updated.
