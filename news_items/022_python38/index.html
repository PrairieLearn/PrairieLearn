<p>
  The version of Python used by PrairieLearn has been upgraded to 3.8
  (it used to be version 3.6). This is the version of Python that
  runs <tt>server.py</tt> for question generation and grading, and
  also the version used for the <tt>prairielearn/grader-python</tt>
  code autograder.

  The new Python version is generally backwards compatible but there
  are some small changes in functionality. For more information see
  the release notes:
