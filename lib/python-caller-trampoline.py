# This program is the glue between python-runner JavaScript code and Python code
#
# It will enter an infinite loop waiting for input. For each input, it
# will load a single Python file and call one top-level function in
# it, passing a list of arguments and returning the entire return
# value of the function.
#
# It is intended that this process will be terminated by sending
# SIGTERM (or SIGKILL if it's stuck).
#
# Input is formatted as JSON on STDIN
# Output is formatted as JSON on file descriptor 3
# Anything written to STDOUT or STDERR will be captured and logged, but it has no meaning
# Errors are signaled by exiting with non-zero exit code
# Exceptions are not caught and so will trigger a process exit with non-zero exit code (signaling an error)
