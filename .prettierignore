# `changesets` ships with an outdated version of Prettier that fights with our
# own version. Until they update their Prettier version or switch to loading

# The `public/localscripts/calculationQuestion` directory unfortunately
# contains a mixture of first-party and vendored third-party scripts. We want
# to format our own scripts, but we should avoid formatting anything that was
