i have various improvements to my agents.md file scattered across branches that aren't merged into master. can you collect/find all those (double check they aren't already added), and add them to the agents.md on this branch

---

this seems like we are making everything worse

---

figure out which of my branches have active, unmerged prs, and look at the agents.md improvements on those

---

yes do 1-6
