# This copies in all the `package.json` files in `apps` and `packages`, which
# Yarn needs to correctly install all dependencies in our workspaces.
# The `--parents` flag is used to preserve parent directories for the sources.
#
# We also need to copy both the `.yarn` directory and the `.yarnrc.yml` file,
# both of which are necessary for Yarn to correctly install dependencies.
#
# Finally, we copy `packages/bind-mount/` since this package contains native
# code that will be built during the install process.

# Install Node dependencies.
#
# The `node-gyp` stuff is a workaround to a bug where multiple instances of `node-gyp`
# end up running at the same time and corrupt the Node headers that are being written
# to disk. This is somewhat of a known issue with Yarn and `node-gyp` specifically:
#
# https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp/issues/1054
# https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/1874
#
# By running `node-gyp install` at the beginning, we ensure that the later invocations
# of `node-gyp` will find the headers already installed and not try to install them
# again, thus avoiding the corruption issue.
#
# If the following issue is ever addressed, we can use that instead:
# https://github.com/yarnpkg/berry/issues/6339
