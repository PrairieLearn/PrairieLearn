# Note that we have to copy the `packages` and `apps` directories into the
# image so that `yarn` can resolve the workspaces inside them and set up
# symlinks correctly.
#
# This is suboptimal, as a change to any file in these directories will
# invalidate this layer's cache, but it's the best option we have for now.
# The alternative is to use a separate `COPY` step for each package/app, but
# this is inexplicably slow on GitHub Actions, taking about 2.5 minutes just to
# execute the `COPY` steps. If Docker implements `COPY --parents` as described
# in https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/35639, we can use that and copy globs
# instead, which should give us the best of both worlds.
#
# We also need to copy both the `.yarn` directory and the `.yarnrc.yml` file,
# both of which are necessary for Yarn to correctly install dependencies.
