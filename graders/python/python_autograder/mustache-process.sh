# Mustache processing intended primarily for use with PrairieLearn external graders.
# Bash script template based on https://betterdev.blog/minimal-safe-bash-script-template/
#
#
# For use in a PrairieLearn autograder: Ensure your Docker image has chevron (or another
# mustache implementation, in which case update the MUSTACHE_EXECUTABLE_NAME and its use 
# below). E.g., add this or equivalent for your installation system to your Dockerfile:
# 
#   RUN pip install chevron
#
# Then, place this script in your autograder server files (or your Docker image).
# Then, run this script with no arguments as part of your entrypoint script in whatever 
# directory you want to process when you want to perform processing. E.g.:
#
#   (cd /grade/tests/ && /grade/shared/autograder/mustache-process.sh)
#
# You may want to use the -d option to delete the original .mustache files. HOWEVER,
# it's also handy in your testing directory to soft-link your .mustache file to a
# non-.mustache version (which you can then use as your test harness, if you're
# careful with how you use {{...}}). If you do that and use -d, you'll end up just
# deleting both files. (If you do NOT use -d, then you risk exposing template
# information into student spaces.)
#
# (You'll adjust that to get the mustache-process.sh path right, most likely changing
# "autograder".) You almost certainly want to perform processing before testing student
# code!
#
# If you/your programming language already uses {{ }} as syntactically meaningful,
# see https://mustache.github.io/mustache.5.html#Set-Delimiter.

USAGE=$(cat <<EOF
Usage: $(basename "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}") [-h] [<formatter>]

Mustache expansion for files in the current subtree with the extension ${MUSTACHE_FILE_PATTERN}.
Results are placed in files with matching paths but without the ${MUSTACHE_FILE_PATTERN} extension.
Formats using <formatter>, defaulting to "${DEFAULT_DATA_SOURCE}".

The extension ${MUSTACHE_FILE_PATTERN} can appear anywhere in the filename
(set off by periods) except at the start, e.g., "foo${MUSTACHE_FILE_PATTERN}.txt".
The subtree is defined by "**"; so, hidden directories are not processed.

Available options:

-d, --delete    Delete the original ${MUSTACHE_FILE_PATTERN} files
-h, --help      Print this help and exit
-v, --verbose   Print script debug info (bash -x option)
