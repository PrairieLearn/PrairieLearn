# We initially based this container on the 'r-ubuntu:20.04' container of the
# Rocker Project which offers us a well-understood and stable basis
# in the form of an Ubuntu LTS release, along with the a) ability to
# deploy the current R version built on that release, and b) to source
# several thousand CRAN packages as r-cran-* binaries via the PPA
# See https://rocker-project.org for Rocker, and the README at
# https://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu/ about R and the binaries
# As of 2022, we extended this to r2u (see https://eddelbuettel.github.io/r2u/)
# which offers _all_ of CRAN as .deb binaries. Among other things this saves us
# one layer here as all R packages now comes as .deb via apt
# (Note that r2u can use install.r but that require root to get from the user
# process via systemd to apt, and the Docker build step does not allow for
# the required security escalation so we just apt as previously but pointing
# at a richer and larger repository with complete CRAN coverage.)
# r2u is now part of rocker so the image is now also rocker/r2u.

# Needed to properly handle UTF-8
ENV PYTHONIOENCODING=UTF-8

# Install required libraries -- using prebuild binaries where available. Because we
# use r2u, the (R package) name can also be mapped to the (Ubuntu) binary provided
# by r2u so instead of, say, 'apt install r-cran-tidyverse' we can now say 'install.r
# tidyverse'. Switching to using the CRAN package names may make it easier to other R
# users to adapt and adjust the package list.  We also install sqlite3 to support the
# SQL lectures. (Adding a duckdb binary may be an option too.)
