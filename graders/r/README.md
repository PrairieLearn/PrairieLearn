## rocker-pl

This is a Docker image working as an external grader to be paired with PrairieLearn. It has been
used in the [STAT 430](https://stat430.com) (2018-2020) and [STAT 447](https://stat430.com) (since 2021) courses on _Data Science Programming Methods_ at the University of Illinois at
Urbana-Champaign. However, the container is perfectly generic and can be used
for general R work as well.

It is based on the [Rocker](https://rocker-project.org) containers in order to take
advantage of the prebuilt Ubuntu binaries available for the stable 'long-term support' (LTS)
releases---both current versions of R itself, as well as current CRAN packages.
In the most recent instance, it uses [r2u](https://eddelbuettel.github.io/r2u/)
which offers _all_ of CRAN as fully depedency-resolved .deb binaries for both
(current) LTS releases (as of Summer/Fall 2022 these are 20.04 and 22.04). We also
rely on [r2u](https://eddelbuettel.github.io/r2u/) in the RStudio Server instance
used for the course.

### R Packages Installed
