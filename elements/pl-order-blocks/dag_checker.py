    largest common subsequence edit distance (allows only additions and deletions, not replacing).
    The naive solution would be to enumerate all topological sorts, then get the edit distance to each of them,
    but this would be too slow. Instead, our algorithm is as follows:
        1. Remove all distractors from the student solution
        2. Construct the 'problematic subgraph'. We do this by finding the subset of nodes in the
        graph that have some 'problematic' relation, meaning that there is a node before it in the
        student solution that should be after it, or one after it that must be before. Thus the
        edge (u,v) is in the problematic subgraph if there is an edge from u to v in the transitive
        closure of the dependency graph, but v appears before u in the student solution.
        3. Find the Minimum Vertex Cover (MVC) of the problematic subgraph. This tells us the
        minimum number of nodes that must be deleted to get rid of all problematic relations.
        4. Once we know the minimum required deletions, you may simply add nodes to the student
        solution until it is the correct solution, so you can directly calculate the edit distance.
